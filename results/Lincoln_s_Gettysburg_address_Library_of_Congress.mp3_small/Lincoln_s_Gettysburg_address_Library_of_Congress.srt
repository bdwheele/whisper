1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,880
The National Cemetery at Gettysburg was dedicated on November the 19th, 1863.

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:16,000
It commemorated the decisive battle of the Great Civil War, which had been fought there

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
some four months earlier.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,600
The oration of the day was delivered by the brilliant orator Edward Everett and occupied

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:33,100
two hours. At its close, President Lincoln, with a few notes which he had penciled on

6
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:39,100
the train while coming from Washington, spoke for barely three minutes.

7
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:46,400
The speech of Everett has been forgotten. The speech of Lincoln will be remembered until

8
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,600
languages are dead and lips are dust.

9
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:57,600
It measures up to all of Daniel Webster's famous requirements that a great speech consists

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,600
of three things, the man, the subject, and the occasion.

11
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,600
These are Lincoln's undying words.

12
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:19,600
Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation

13
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:28,600
conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

14
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:39,600
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived

15
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,600
and so dedicated can long endure.

16
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,600
We are met on a great battlefield of that war.

17
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:57,600
We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who

18
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,600
here gave their lives that that nation might live.

19
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,600
It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

20
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:15,600
But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate.

21
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,600
We cannot consecrate.

22
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,600
We cannot hallow this ground.

23
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:33,600
The brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above power for

24
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,600
power to add or detract.

25
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:45,600
The world will little note no longer remember what we say here, but it can never forget

26
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,600
what they did here.

27
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:56,600
It is for us living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who

28
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:02,600
fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.

29
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:10,600
It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us.

30
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:19,600
That from these honored heads we take increased devotion to that cause for which they here

31
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:25,600
gave the last full measure of devotion.

32
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:32,600
That we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain.

33
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:38,600
That this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom.

34
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:49,600
And that government of the people, by the people and for the people shall not perish from the earth.
