[00:00.000 --> 00:09.880]  The National Cemetery at Gettysburg was dedicated on November the 19th, 1863.
[00:09.880 --> 00:16.000]  It commemorated the decisive battle of the Great Civil War, which had been fought there
[00:16.000 --> 00:19.000]  some four months earlier.
[00:19.000 --> 00:25.600]  The oration of the day was delivered by the brilliant orator Edward Everett and occupied
[00:25.600 --> 00:33.100]  two hours. At its close, President Lincoln, with a few notes which he had penciled on
[00:33.100 --> 00:39.100]  the train while coming from Washington, spoke for barely three minutes.
[00:39.100 --> 00:46.400]  The speech of Everett has been forgotten. The speech of Lincoln will be remembered until
[00:46.400 --> 00:50.600]  languages are dead and lips are dust.
[00:50.600 --> 00:57.600]  It measures up to all of Daniel Webster's famous requirements that a great speech consists
[00:57.600 --> 01:03.600]  of three things, the man, the subject, and the occasion.
[01:03.600 --> 01:08.600]  These are Lincoln's undying words.
[01:08.600 --> 01:19.600]  Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation
[01:19.600 --> 01:28.600]  conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
[01:28.600 --> 01:39.600]  Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived
[01:39.600 --> 01:44.600]  and so dedicated can long endure.
[01:44.600 --> 01:49.600]  We are met on a great battlefield of that war.
[01:49.600 --> 01:57.600]  We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who
[01:57.600 --> 02:03.600]  here gave their lives that that nation might live.
[02:03.600 --> 02:09.600]  It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
[02:09.600 --> 02:15.600]  But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate.
[02:15.600 --> 02:18.600]  We cannot consecrate.
[02:18.600 --> 02:23.600]  We cannot hallow this ground.
[02:23.600 --> 02:33.600]  The brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above power for
[02:33.600 --> 02:37.600]  power to add or detract.
[02:37.600 --> 02:45.600]  The world will little note no longer remember what we say here, but it can never forget
[02:45.600 --> 02:48.600]  what they did here.
[02:48.600 --> 02:56.600]  It is for us living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who
[02:56.600 --> 03:02.600]  fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.
[03:02.600 --> 03:10.600]  It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us.
[03:10.600 --> 03:19.600]  That from these honored heads we take increased devotion to that cause for which they here
[03:19.600 --> 03:25.600]  gave the last full measure of devotion.
[03:25.600 --> 03:32.600]  That we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain.
[03:32.600 --> 03:38.600]  That this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom.
[03:38.600 --> 03:49.600]  And that government of the people, by the people and for the people shall not perish from the earth.
