0	9880	The National Cemetery at Gettysburg was dedicated on November the 19th, 1863.
9880	16000	It commemorated the decisive battle of the Great Civil War, which had been fought there
16000	19000	some four months earlier.
19000	25600	The oration of the day was delivered by the brilliant orator Edward Everett and occupied
25600	33100	two hours. At its close, President Lincoln, with a few notes which he had penciled on
33100	39100	the train while coming from Washington, spoke for barely three minutes.
39100	46400	The speech of Everett has been forgotten. The speech of Lincoln will be remembered until
46400	50600	languages are dead and lips are dust.
50600	57600	It measures up to all of Daniel Webster's famous requirements that a great speech consists
57600	63600	of three things, the man, the subject, and the occasion.
63600	68600	These are Lincoln's undying words.
68600	79600	Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation
79600	88600	conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
88600	99600	Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived
99600	104600	and so dedicated can long endure.
104600	109600	We are met on a great battlefield of that war.
109600	117600	We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who
117600	123600	here gave their lives that that nation might live.
123600	129600	It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
129600	135600	But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate.
135600	138600	We cannot consecrate.
138600	143600	We cannot hallow this ground.
143600	153600	The brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above power for
153600	157600	power to add or detract.
157600	165600	The world will little note no longer remember what we say here, but it can never forget
165600	168600	what they did here.
168600	176600	It is for us living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who
176600	182600	fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.
182600	190600	It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us.
190600	199600	That from these honored heads we take increased devotion to that cause for which they here
199600	205600	gave the last full measure of devotion.
205600	212600	That we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain.
212600	218600	That this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom.
218600	229600	And that government of the people, by the people and for the people shall not perish from the earth.
