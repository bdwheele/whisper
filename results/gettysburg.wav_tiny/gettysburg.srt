00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
140 years ago today, President Abraham Lincoln stood at the side of one of the most important

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,640
battles of the U.S. Civil War in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, a crowd of some 15,000

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:17,520
gathered to consecrate a cemetery for Union War dead. Though brief, the now-famous Gettysburg

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,360
dress marked a defining moment of the Civil War. Actor Sam Watterston has portrayed President

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:30,920
Lincoln on stage and screen. Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought

6
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:39,680
forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:49,960
that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether

8
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:59,360
that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met

9
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:06,760
on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as

10
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:14,960
a final resting place, for those who hear gave their lives that that nation might live. It

11
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:24,720
is all together fitting and proper that we should do this. But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate,

12
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:32,960
we cannot consecrate, we cannot hellow this ground. The brave men living in dead who struggled

13
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:42,440
here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or to track. The world will little

14
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:50,200
note no longer remember what we say here. But it can never forget what they did here. It

15
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:56,040
is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work, which they who fought

16
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:03,360
here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great

17
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:11,600
task remaining before us. That from these honored dead, we take increased devotion to

18
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:19,920
that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion. That we here highly

19
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:29,800
resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation under God shall have

20
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:41,800
a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not

21
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,800
perish from the earth.

22
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,520
Actor Sam Waterston reading the Gettysburg Address delivered by President Abraham Lincoln

23
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:54,920
140 years ago today. Waterston also is a leading member of the Advisory Committee of the Abraham

24
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,960
Lincoln By Centennial Commission, which is charged with planning the celebration of Lincoln's

25
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,360
200th birthday in 2009.
