[00:00.000 --> 00:06.240]  140 years ago today, President Abraham Lincoln stood at the side of one of the most important
[00:06.240 --> 00:11.640]  battles of the U.S. Civil War in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, a crowd of some 15,000
[00:11.640 --> 00:17.520]  gathered to consecrate a cemetery for Union War dead. Though brief, the now-famous Gettysburg
[00:17.520 --> 00:23.360]  dress marked a defining moment of the Civil War. Actor Sam Watterston has portrayed President
[00:23.360 --> 00:30.920]  Lincoln on stage and screen. Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought
[00:30.920 --> 00:39.680]  forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition
[00:39.680 --> 00:49.960]  that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether
[00:49.960 --> 00:59.360]  that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met
[00:59.360 --> 01:06.760]  on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as
[01:06.760 --> 01:14.960]  a final resting place, for those who hear gave their lives that that nation might live. It
[01:14.960 --> 01:24.720]  is all together fitting and proper that we should do this. But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate,
[01:24.720 --> 01:32.960]  we cannot consecrate, we cannot hellow this ground. The brave men living in dead who struggled
[01:32.960 --> 01:42.440]  here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or to track. The world will little
[01:42.440 --> 01:50.200]  note no longer remember what we say here. But it can never forget what they did here. It
[01:50.200 --> 01:56.040]  is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work, which they who fought
[01:56.040 --> 02:03.360]  here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great
[02:03.360 --> 02:11.600]  task remaining before us. That from these honored dead, we take increased devotion to
[02:11.640 --> 02:19.920]  that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion. That we here highly
[02:19.920 --> 02:29.800]  resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation under God shall have
[02:29.880 --> 02:41.800]  a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not
[02:41.800 --> 02:43.800]  perish from the earth.

[02:59.960 --> 03:02.360]  200th birthday in 2009.
