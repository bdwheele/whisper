0	6240	140 years ago today, President Abraham Lincoln stood at the side of one of the most important
6240	11640	battles of the U.S. Civil War in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, a crowd of some 15,000
11640	17520	gathered to consecrate a cemetery for Union War dead. Though brief, the now-famous Gettysburg
17520	23360	dress marked a defining moment of the Civil War. Actor Sam Watterston has portrayed President
23360	30920	Lincoln on stage and screen. Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought
30920	39680	forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition
39680	49960	that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether
49960	59360	that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met
59360	66760	on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as
66760	74960	a final resting place, for those who hear gave their lives that that nation might live. It
74960	84720	is all together fitting and proper that we should do this. But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate,
84720	92960	we cannot consecrate, we cannot hellow this ground. The brave men living in dead who struggled
92960	102440	here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or to track. The world will little
102440	110200	note no longer remember what we say here. But it can never forget what they did here. It
110200	116040	is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work, which they who fought
116040	123360	here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great
123360	131600	task remaining before us. That from these honored dead, we take increased devotion to
131640	139920	that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion. That we here highly
139920	149800	resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation under God shall have
149880	161800	a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not
161800	163800	perish from the earth.

179960	182360	200th birthday in 2009.
