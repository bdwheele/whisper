00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,280
140 years ago today, President Abraham Lincoln stood at the site of one of the most important

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:12,120
battles of the U.S. Civil War in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. A crowd of some 15,000 had gathered

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,920
to consecrate a cemetery for Union war-dead. Though brief, the now-famous Gettysburg Address

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,360
marked a defining moment of the Civil War. Actor Sam Waterston has portrayed President

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:31,240
Lincoln on stage and screen. Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth

6
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:39,720
on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition

7
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:49,960
that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether

8
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:59,440
that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met

9
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:06,740
on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as

10
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:14,960
a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It

11
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:23,040
is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But in a larger sense we cannot

12
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:31,720
dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men living

13
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:40,600
and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract.

14
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:47,560
The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget

15
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:53,960
what they did here. It is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished

16
00:01:53,960 --> 00:02:01,400
work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us

17
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:09,560
to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us, that from these honored dead we

18
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:17,640
take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion,

19
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:27,520
that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation

20
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:39,040
under God shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people by the people

21
00:02:39,040 --> 00:03:02,360
shall not perish from the earth.
