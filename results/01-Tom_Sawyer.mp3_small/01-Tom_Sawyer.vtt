00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
A Monday warrior, meet me stride Today's Tom Sawyer, meet me pride

00:11.000 --> 00:28.000
Though his mind is not for him Don't put him down as air again

00:28.000 --> 00:34.000
His reserve of quiet defence Riding out the days of ends

00:34.000 --> 00:52.000
And don't revoke

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
What do you say about his company? Is what you say about society?

00:57.000 --> 01:11.000
Catch the myth, catch the mystery, catch the grip

01:11.000 --> 01:18.000
The world is, the world is Love and life are deep

01:18.000 --> 01:28.000
Maybe as it skies are wide

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
Today's Tom Sawyer, he gets high on you And the space he invades, he gets by on you

01:41.000 --> 01:57.000
Love and life are deep

01:57.000 --> 02:07.000
Love and life are deep

02:28.000 --> 02:43.000
Love and life are deep

02:43.000 --> 02:48.000
Though his mind is not for him To any God of government

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
Always hopeful you're discontent Though changes are permanent

02:54.000 --> 03:12.000
More changes

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
What do you say about his company? Is what you say about society?

03:18.000 --> 03:31.000
Catch the witness, catch the whip Catch the spirit, catch the spirit

03:31.000 --> 03:38.000
The world is, the world is Love and life are deep

03:39.000 --> 03:48.000
Maybe as it skies are wide

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
Exit the worry of today's Tom Sawyer, he gets high on you

03:52.000 --> 03:58.000
And the energy you train, he gets by on to the friction of the day

04:08.000 --> 04:18.000
Love and life are deep
