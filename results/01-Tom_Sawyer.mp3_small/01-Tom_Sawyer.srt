1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
A Monday warrior, meet me stride Today's Tom Sawyer, meet me pride

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Though his mind is not for him Don't put him down as air again

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
His reserve of quiet defence Riding out the days of ends

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And don't revoke

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What do you say about his company? Is what you say about society?

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Catch the myth, catch the mystery, catch the grip

7
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The world is, the world is Love and life are deep

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Maybe as it skies are wide

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Today's Tom Sawyer, he gets high on you And the space he invades, he gets by on you

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Love and life are deep

11
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Love and life are deep

12
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Love and life are deep

13
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Though his mind is not for him To any God of government

14
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Always hopeful you're discontent Though changes are permanent

15
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:12,000
More changes

16
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What do you say about his company? Is what you say about society?

17
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Catch the witness, catch the whip Catch the spirit, catch the spirit

18
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The world is, the world is Love and life are deep

19
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Maybe as it skies are wide

20
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Exit the worry of today's Tom Sawyer, he gets high on you

21
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And the energy you train, he gets by on to the friction of the day

22
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Love and life are deep
