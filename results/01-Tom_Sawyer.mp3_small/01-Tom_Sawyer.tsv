0	11000	A Monday warrior, meet me stride Today's Tom Sawyer, meet me pride
11000	28000	Though his mind is not for him Don't put him down as air again
28000	34000	His reserve of quiet defence Riding out the days of ends
34000	52000	And don't revoke
52000	57000	What do you say about his company? Is what you say about society?
57000	71000	Catch the myth, catch the mystery, catch the grip
71000	78000	The world is, the world is Love and life are deep
78000	88000	Maybe as it skies are wide
88000	93000	Today's Tom Sawyer, he gets high on you And the space he invades, he gets by on you
101000	117000	Love and life are deep
117000	127000	Love and life are deep
148000	163000	Love and life are deep
163000	168000	Though his mind is not for him To any God of government
168000	174000	Always hopeful you're discontent Though changes are permanent
174000	192000	More changes
192000	198000	What do you say about his company? Is what you say about society?
198000	211000	Catch the witness, catch the whip Catch the spirit, catch the spirit
211000	218000	The world is, the world is Love and life are deep
219000	228000	Maybe as it skies are wide
228000	232000	Exit the worry of today's Tom Sawyer, he gets high on you
232000	238000	And the energy you train, he gets by on to the friction of the day
248000	258000	Love and life are deep
