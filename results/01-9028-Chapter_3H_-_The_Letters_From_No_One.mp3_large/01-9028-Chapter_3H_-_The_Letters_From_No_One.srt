1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,280
Wouldn't it be better just to go home, dear, Aunt Petunia suggested timidly hours later.

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,120
But Uncle Vernon didn't seem to hear her.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,960
Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,920
He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,620
back into the car, and off they went again.

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,440
The same thing happened in the middle of a ploughed field, halfway across a suspension

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,080
bridge, and at the top of a multi-level parking garage.

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,320
Daddy's gone bad, hasn't he?

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,040
Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully later that afternoon.

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:40,080
Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,120
It started to rain, great drops beat on the roof of the car.

12
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,120
Dudley snivelled.

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,960
It's Monday, he told his mother.

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,680
The great Humberto's on tonight.

15
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,640
I want to stay somewhere with the television.

16
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,520
Monday, this reminded Harry of something.

17
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,980
If it was Monday, and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days of the week because

18
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:08,840
of television, then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry's 11th birthday.

19
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,200
Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun.

20
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,520
Last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks.

21
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,920
Still, you weren't 11 every day.

22
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,880
Uncle Vernon was back, and he was smiling.

23
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,480
He was also carrying a long, thin package, and didn't answer Aunt Petunia when she asked

24
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,480
what he'd bought.

25
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,000
Found the perfect place, he said.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,920
Come on, everyone out.

27
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,440
It was very cold outside the car.

28
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,600
Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea.

29
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,960
Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine.

30
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,400
One thing was certain, there was no television in there.

31
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:54,720
Some forecast for tonight, said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together, and

32
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,080
this gentleman's kindly agreed to lend us his boat.

33
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:03,800
A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an

34
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,440
old rowboat bobbing in the iron-grey water below them.

35
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:13,360
I've already got us some rations, said Uncle Vernon, so all aboard.

36
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,600
It was freezing in the boat.

37
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,760
Heavy sea spray and rain crept down their necks, and a chilly wind whipped their faces.

38
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,120
After what seemed like hours, they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and

39
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,360
sliding, led the way to the broken-down house.

40
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,400
The inside was horrible.

41
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,720
It smelled strongly of seaweed.

42
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,160
The wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and

43
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,160
empty.

44
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,000
There were only two rooms.

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,720
Uncle Vernon's rations turned out to be a bag of chips each, and four bananas.

46
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,040
He tried to start a fire, but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.

47
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:57,200
Could do with some of those letters now, eh? he said cheerfully.

48
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,080
He was in a very good mood.

49
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,520
Obviously, he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver

50
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,680
mail.

51
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,520
Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn't cheer him up at all.
