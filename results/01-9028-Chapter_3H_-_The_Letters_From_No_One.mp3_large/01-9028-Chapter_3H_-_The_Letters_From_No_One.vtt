00:00.000 --> 00:06.280
Wouldn't it be better just to go home, dear, Aunt Petunia suggested timidly hours later.

00:06.280 --> 00:09.120
But Uncle Vernon didn't seem to hear her.

00:09.120 --> 00:11.960
Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew.

00:11.960 --> 00:16.920
He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got

00:16.920 --> 00:19.620
back into the car, and off they went again.

00:19.620 --> 00:23.440
The same thing happened in the middle of a ploughed field, halfway across a suspension

00:23.440 --> 00:27.080
bridge, and at the top of a multi-level parking garage.

00:27.800 --> 00:30.320
Daddy's gone bad, hasn't he?

00:30.320 --> 00:34.040
Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully later that afternoon.

00:34.040 --> 00:40.080
Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.

00:40.080 --> 00:44.120
It started to rain, great drops beat on the roof of the car.

00:44.120 --> 00:45.120
Dudley snivelled.

00:45.120 --> 00:47.960
It's Monday, he told his mother.

00:47.960 --> 00:50.680
The great Humberto's on tonight.

00:50.680 --> 00:54.640
I want to stay somewhere with the television.

00:54.680 --> 00:58.520
Monday, this reminded Harry of something.

00:58.520 --> 01:02.980
If it was Monday, and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days of the week because

01:02.980 --> 01:08.840
of television, then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry's 11th birthday.

01:08.840 --> 01:12.200
Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun.

01:12.200 --> 01:16.520
Last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks.

01:16.520 --> 01:19.920
Still, you weren't 11 every day.

01:19.920 --> 01:21.880
Uncle Vernon was back, and he was smiling.

01:21.880 --> 01:26.480
He was also carrying a long, thin package, and didn't answer Aunt Petunia when she asked

01:26.480 --> 01:28.480
what he'd bought.

01:28.480 --> 01:31.000
Found the perfect place, he said.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.920
Come on, everyone out.

01:33.920 --> 01:36.440
It was very cold outside the car.

01:36.440 --> 01:40.600
Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea.

01:40.600 --> 01:44.960
Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine.

01:44.960 --> 01:49.400
One thing was certain, there was no television in there.

01:49.400 --> 01:54.720
Some forecast for tonight, said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together, and

01:54.720 --> 01:59.080
this gentleman's kindly agreed to lend us his boat.

01:59.080 --> 02:03.800
A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an

02:03.800 --> 02:07.440
old rowboat bobbing in the iron-grey water below them.

02:07.440 --> 02:13.360
I've already got us some rations, said Uncle Vernon, so all aboard.

02:13.360 --> 02:15.600
It was freezing in the boat.

02:15.600 --> 02:20.760
Heavy sea spray and rain crept down their necks, and a chilly wind whipped their faces.

02:20.760 --> 02:25.120
After what seemed like hours, they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and

02:25.120 --> 02:28.360
sliding, led the way to the broken-down house.

02:28.360 --> 02:30.400
The inside was horrible.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.720
It smelled strongly of seaweed.

02:32.720 --> 02:37.160
The wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and

02:37.160 --> 02:38.160
empty.

02:38.160 --> 02:41.000
There were only two rooms.

02:41.000 --> 02:46.720
Uncle Vernon's rations turned out to be a bag of chips each, and four bananas.

02:46.720 --> 02:52.040
He tried to start a fire, but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.

02:52.040 --> 02:57.200
Could do with some of those letters now, eh? he said cheerfully.

02:57.200 --> 02:59.080
He was in a very good mood.

02:59.080 --> 03:03.520
Obviously, he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver

03:03.520 --> 03:04.680
mail.

03:04.680 --> 03:08.520
Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn't cheer him up at all.
