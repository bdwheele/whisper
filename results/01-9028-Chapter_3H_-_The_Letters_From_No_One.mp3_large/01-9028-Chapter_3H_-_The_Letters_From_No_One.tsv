0	6280	Wouldn't it be better just to go home, dear, Aunt Petunia suggested timidly hours later.
6280	9120	But Uncle Vernon didn't seem to hear her.
9120	11960	Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew.
11960	16920	He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got
16920	19620	back into the car, and off they went again.
19620	23440	The same thing happened in the middle of a ploughed field, halfway across a suspension
23440	27080	bridge, and at the top of a multi-level parking garage.
27800	30320	Daddy's gone bad, hasn't he?
30320	34040	Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully later that afternoon.
34040	40080	Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.
40080	44120	It started to rain, great drops beat on the roof of the car.
44120	45120	Dudley snivelled.
45120	47960	It's Monday, he told his mother.
47960	50680	The great Humberto's on tonight.
50680	54640	I want to stay somewhere with the television.
54680	58520	Monday, this reminded Harry of something.
58520	62980	If it was Monday, and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days of the week because
62980	68840	of television, then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry's 11th birthday.
68840	72200	Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun.
72200	76520	Last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks.
76520	79920	Still, you weren't 11 every day.
79920	81880	Uncle Vernon was back, and he was smiling.
81880	86480	He was also carrying a long, thin package, and didn't answer Aunt Petunia when she asked
86480	88480	what he'd bought.
88480	91000	Found the perfect place, he said.
91000	93920	Come on, everyone out.
93920	96440	It was very cold outside the car.
96440	100600	Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea.
100600	104960	Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine.
104960	109400	One thing was certain, there was no television in there.
109400	114720	Some forecast for tonight, said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together, and
114720	119080	this gentleman's kindly agreed to lend us his boat.
119080	123800	A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an
123800	127440	old rowboat bobbing in the iron-grey water below them.
127440	133360	I've already got us some rations, said Uncle Vernon, so all aboard.
133360	135600	It was freezing in the boat.
135600	140760	Heavy sea spray and rain crept down their necks, and a chilly wind whipped their faces.
140760	145120	After what seemed like hours, they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and
145120	148360	sliding, led the way to the broken-down house.
148360	150400	The inside was horrible.
150400	152720	It smelled strongly of seaweed.
152720	157160	The wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and
157160	158160	empty.
158160	161000	There were only two rooms.
161000	166720	Uncle Vernon's rations turned out to be a bag of chips each, and four bananas.
166720	172040	He tried to start a fire, but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.
172040	177200	Could do with some of those letters now, eh? he said cheerfully.
177200	179080	He was in a very good mood.
179080	183520	Obviously, he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver
183520	184680	mail.
184680	188520	Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn't cheer him up at all.
