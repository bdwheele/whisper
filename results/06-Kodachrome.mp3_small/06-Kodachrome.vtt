00:00.000 --> 00:20.000
When I think back on all the crap I learned in high school

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
It's a wonder I can't think at all

00:27.000 --> 00:33.000
And when my lack of education hasn't hurt me none

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
I can read the writing on the wall

00:39.000 --> 00:46.000
Cold or cold, it gives those nice bright colors

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Gives us the greens of summers

00:49.000 --> 00:55.000
Makes you think all the words of a sunny day

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
Oh yeah, I got an eye on camera

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
I'd love to take a photograph

01:03.000 --> 01:09.000
So mama don't take my cold control away

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
If you took all the girls I knew when I was sailor

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
And brought them all together for one night

01:27.000 --> 01:33.000
I know they never match my sweet imagination

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
And everything looks worse in black and white

01:40.000 --> 01:47.000
Cold or cold, it gives those nice bright colors

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
Gives us the greens of summers

01:50.000 --> 01:56.000
Makes you think all the words of a sunny day

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
Oh yeah, I got an eye on camera

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
I'd love to take a photograph

02:04.000 --> 02:11.000
So mama don't take my cold control away

02:12.000 --> 02:21.000
Mama don't take my cold control away

02:22.000 --> 02:28.000
Mama don't take my cold control away

02:29.000 --> 02:35.000
Mama don't take my cold control away

02:36.000 --> 02:44.000
Mama don't take my cold control away

02:44.000 --> 02:51.000
Mama don't take my cold control away

02:51.000 --> 02:57.000
Mama don't take my cold control away

03:05.000 --> 03:12.000
Mama don't take my cold control away

03:12.000 --> 03:19.000
Mama don't take my cold control away
