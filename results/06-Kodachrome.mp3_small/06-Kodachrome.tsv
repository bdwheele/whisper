0	20000	When I think back on all the crap I learned in high school
21000	26000	It's a wonder I can't think at all
27000	33000	And when my lack of education hasn't hurt me none
35000	39000	I can read the writing on the wall
39000	46000	Cold or cold, it gives those nice bright colors
46000	49000	Gives us the greens of summers
49000	55000	Makes you think all the words of a sunny day
55000	59000	Oh yeah, I got an eye on camera
59000	63000	I'd love to take a photograph
63000	69000	So mama don't take my cold control away
74000	79000	If you took all the girls I knew when I was sailor
82000	86000	And brought them all together for one night
87000	93000	I know they never match my sweet imagination
96000	100000	And everything looks worse in black and white
100000	107000	Cold or cold, it gives those nice bright colors
107000	110000	Gives us the greens of summers
110000	116000	Makes you think all the words of a sunny day
116000	121000	Oh yeah, I got an eye on camera
121000	124000	I'd love to take a photograph
124000	131000	So mama don't take my cold control away
132000	141000	Mama don't take my cold control away
142000	148000	Mama don't take my cold control away
149000	155000	Mama don't take my cold control away
156000	164000	Mama don't take my cold control away
164000	171000	Mama don't take my cold control away
171000	177000	Mama don't take my cold control away
185000	192000	Mama don't take my cold control away
192000	199000	Mama don't take my cold control away
