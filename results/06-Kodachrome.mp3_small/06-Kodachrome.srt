1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
When I think back on all the crap I learned in high school

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's a wonder I can't think at all

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And when my lack of education hasn't hurt me none

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I can read the writing on the wall

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Cold or cold, it gives those nice bright colors

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Gives us the greens of summers

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Makes you think all the words of a sunny day

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Oh yeah, I got an eye on camera

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'd love to take a photograph

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So mama don't take my cold control away

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
If you took all the girls I knew when I was sailor

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And brought them all together for one night

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I know they never match my sweet imagination

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And everything looks worse in black and white

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Cold or cold, it gives those nice bright colors

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Gives us the greens of summers

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Makes you think all the words of a sunny day

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Oh yeah, I got an eye on camera

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'd love to take a photograph

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So mama don't take my cold control away

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Mama don't take my cold control away

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Mama don't take my cold control away

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Mama don't take my cold control away

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Mama don't take my cold control away

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Mama don't take my cold control away

26
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Mama don't take my cold control away

27
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Mama don't take my cold control away

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Mama don't take my cold control away
