1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
Wouldn't it be better just to go home, dear?"

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,280
Aunt Petunia suggested timidly hours later.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,120
But Uncle Vernon didn't seem to hear her.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,960
Exactly what he was looking for none of them knew.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,880
He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,600
back into the car, and off they went again.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,280
The same thing happened in the middle of a ploughed field, half-way across a suspension

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,080
bridge and at the top of a multi-level parking garage.

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,600
Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,280
Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully later that afternoon.

11
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:40,080
Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,360
It started to rain, great drops beat on the roof of the car.

13
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,360
Dudley snivelled.

14
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,980
It's Monday, he told his mother.

15
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,680
The great Humberto's on tonight.

16
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,880
I want to stay somewhere with the television.

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,360
Monday.

18
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,500
This reminded Harry of something.

19
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,960
If it was Monday, and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days of the week because

20
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,800
of television, then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry's eleventh birthday.

21
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,180
Of course his birthdays were never exactly fun.

22
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,640
Last year the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks.

23
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,880
Still you weren't eleven every day.

24
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,840
Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling.

25
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,440
He was also carrying a long thin package and didn't answer Aunt Petunia when she asked

26
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,480
what he'd bought.

27
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,000
Found the perfect place, he said.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,920
Come on, everyone out.

29
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,400
It was very cold outside the car.

30
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,640
Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea.

31
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,940
Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine.

32
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:49,360
One thing was certain, there was no television in there.

33
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,720
Some forecast for tonight, said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together, and

34
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,080
this gentleman's kindly agreed to lend us his boat.

35
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:04,080
A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing with a rather wicked grin at an old

36
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,800
rowboat bobbing in the iron grey water below them.

37
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:13,360
I've already got us some rations, said Uncle Vernon, so all aboard.

38
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,280
It was freezing in the boat.

39
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,760
Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces.

40
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,680
After what seemed like hours, they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and

41
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,360
sliding, led the way to the broken down house.

42
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,420
The inside was horrible.

43
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,720
It smelled strongly of seaweed.

44
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,080
The wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls and the fireplace was damp and

45
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,080
empty.

46
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,040
There were only two rooms.

47
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,720
Uncle Vernon's rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas.

48
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,040
He tried to start a fire, but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.

49
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,080
Could do with some of those letters now, eh?

50
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,180
He said cheerfully.

51
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:02,240
He was in a very good mood, obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here

52
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,640
in a storm to deliver mail.

53
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,480
Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn't cheer him up at all.
