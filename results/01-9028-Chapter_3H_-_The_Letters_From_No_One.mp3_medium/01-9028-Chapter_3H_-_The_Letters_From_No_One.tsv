0	3240	Wouldn't it be better just to go home, dear?"
3240	6280	Aunt Petunia suggested timidly hours later.
6280	9120	But Uncle Vernon didn't seem to hear her.
9120	11960	Exactly what he was looking for none of them knew.
11960	16880	He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got
16880	19600	back into the car, and off they went again.
19600	23280	The same thing happened in the middle of a ploughed field, half-way across a suspension
23280	27080	bridge and at the top of a multi-level parking garage.
27840	30600	Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?
30600	34280	Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully later that afternoon.
34280	40080	Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.
40080	44360	It started to rain, great drops beat on the roof of the car.
44360	45360	Dudley snivelled.
45360	47980	It's Monday, he told his mother.
47980	50680	The great Humberto's on tonight.
50680	54880	I want to stay somewhere with the television.
54880	56360	Monday.
56360	58500	This reminded Harry of something.
58500	62960	If it was Monday, and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days of the week because
62960	68800	of television, then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry's eleventh birthday.
68800	72180	Of course his birthdays were never exactly fun.
72180	76640	Last year the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks.
76640	79880	Still you weren't eleven every day.
79880	81840	Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling.
81880	86440	He was also carrying a long thin package and didn't answer Aunt Petunia when she asked
86440	88480	what he'd bought.
88480	91000	Found the perfect place, he said.
91000	93920	Come on, everyone out.
93920	96400	It was very cold outside the car.
96400	100640	Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea.
100640	104940	Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine.
104940	109360	One thing was certain, there was no television in there.
109360	114720	Some forecast for tonight, said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together, and
114720	119080	this gentleman's kindly agreed to lend us his boat.
119080	124080	A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing with a rather wicked grin at an old
124080	127800	rowboat bobbing in the iron grey water below them.
127800	133360	I've already got us some rations, said Uncle Vernon, so all aboard.
133360	135280	It was freezing in the boat.
135280	140760	Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces.
140760	144680	After what seemed like hours, they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and
144680	148360	sliding, led the way to the broken down house.
148360	150420	The inside was horrible.
150420	152720	It smelled strongly of seaweed.
152720	157080	The wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls and the fireplace was damp and
157080	158080	empty.
158080	161040	There were only two rooms.
161080	166720	Uncle Vernon's rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas.
166720	172040	He tried to start a fire, but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.
172040	175080	Could do with some of those letters now, eh?
175080	177180	He said cheerfully.
177180	182240	He was in a very good mood, obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here
182240	184640	in a storm to deliver mail.
184640	188480	Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn't cheer him up at all.
