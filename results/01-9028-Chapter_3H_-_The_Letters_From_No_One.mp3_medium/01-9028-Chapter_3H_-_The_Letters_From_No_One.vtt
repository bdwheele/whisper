00:00.000 --> 00:03.240
Wouldn't it be better just to go home, dear?"

00:03.240 --> 00:06.280
Aunt Petunia suggested timidly hours later.

00:06.280 --> 00:09.120
But Uncle Vernon didn't seem to hear her.

00:09.120 --> 00:11.960
Exactly what he was looking for none of them knew.

00:11.960 --> 00:16.880
He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got

00:16.880 --> 00:19.600
back into the car, and off they went again.

00:19.600 --> 00:23.280
The same thing happened in the middle of a ploughed field, half-way across a suspension

00:23.280 --> 00:27.080
bridge and at the top of a multi-level parking garage.

00:27.840 --> 00:30.600
Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?

00:30.600 --> 00:34.280
Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully later that afternoon.

00:34.280 --> 00:40.080
Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.

00:40.080 --> 00:44.360
It started to rain, great drops beat on the roof of the car.

00:44.360 --> 00:45.360
Dudley snivelled.

00:45.360 --> 00:47.980
It's Monday, he told his mother.

00:47.980 --> 00:50.680
The great Humberto's on tonight.

00:50.680 --> 00:54.880
I want to stay somewhere with the television.

00:54.880 --> 00:56.360
Monday.

00:56.360 --> 00:58.500
This reminded Harry of something.

00:58.500 --> 01:02.960
If it was Monday, and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days of the week because

01:02.960 --> 01:08.800
of television, then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry's eleventh birthday.

01:08.800 --> 01:12.180
Of course his birthdays were never exactly fun.

01:12.180 --> 01:16.640
Last year the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks.

01:16.640 --> 01:19.880
Still you weren't eleven every day.

01:19.880 --> 01:21.840
Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling.

01:21.880 --> 01:26.440
He was also carrying a long thin package and didn't answer Aunt Petunia when she asked

01:26.440 --> 01:28.480
what he'd bought.

01:28.480 --> 01:31.000
Found the perfect place, he said.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.920
Come on, everyone out.

01:33.920 --> 01:36.400
It was very cold outside the car.

01:36.400 --> 01:40.640
Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea.

01:40.640 --> 01:44.940
Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine.

01:44.940 --> 01:49.360
One thing was certain, there was no television in there.

01:49.360 --> 01:54.720
Some forecast for tonight, said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together, and

01:54.720 --> 01:59.080
this gentleman's kindly agreed to lend us his boat.

01:59.080 --> 02:04.080
A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing with a rather wicked grin at an old

02:04.080 --> 02:07.800
rowboat bobbing in the iron grey water below them.

02:07.800 --> 02:13.360
I've already got us some rations, said Uncle Vernon, so all aboard.

02:13.360 --> 02:15.280
It was freezing in the boat.

02:15.280 --> 02:20.760
Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces.

02:20.760 --> 02:24.680
After what seemed like hours, they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and

02:24.680 --> 02:28.360
sliding, led the way to the broken down house.

02:28.360 --> 02:30.420
The inside was horrible.

02:30.420 --> 02:32.720
It smelled strongly of seaweed.

02:32.720 --> 02:37.080
The wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls and the fireplace was damp and

02:37.080 --> 02:38.080
empty.

02:38.080 --> 02:41.040
There were only two rooms.

02:41.080 --> 02:46.720
Uncle Vernon's rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas.

02:46.720 --> 02:52.040
He tried to start a fire, but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.

02:52.040 --> 02:55.080
Could do with some of those letters now, eh?

02:55.080 --> 02:57.180
He said cheerfully.

02:57.180 --> 03:02.240
He was in a very good mood, obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here

03:02.240 --> 03:04.640
in a storm to deliver mail.

03:04.640 --> 03:08.480
Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn't cheer him up at all.
