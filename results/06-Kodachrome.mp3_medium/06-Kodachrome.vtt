When I think back on all the crap I learned in high school

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
It's a wonder I can't think at all

00:26.000 --> 00:34.000
And though my lack of education hasn't hurt me none

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
I can read the writing on the wall

00:39.000 --> 00:46.000
Kodachrome, it gives us those nice bright colors

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Gives us the greens of summers

00:49.000 --> 00:55.000
Makes you think all the words of a sunny day

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
Oh yeah, I got an icon camera

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
I love to take a photograph

01:03.000 --> 01:10.000
So mama don't take my Kodachrome away

01:14.000 --> 01:22.000
If you took all the girls I knew when I was single

01:22.000 --> 01:28.000
And brought them all together for one night

01:28.000 --> 01:36.000
I know they'd never match my sweet imagination

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
And everything looks worse in black and white

01:40.000 --> 01:47.000
Kodachrome, it gives us those nice bright colors

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
Gives us the greens of summers

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
Makes you think all the words of a sunny day

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
Oh yeah, I got an icon camera

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
I love to take a photograph

02:04.000 --> 02:10.000
So mama don't take my Kodachrome away

02:11.000 --> 02:17.000
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away

02:17.000 --> 02:23.000
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away

02:23.000 --> 02:33.000
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away

02:38.000 --> 02:46.000
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Leave your bars up off the phone

02:48.000 --> 02:55.000
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
Kodachrome
