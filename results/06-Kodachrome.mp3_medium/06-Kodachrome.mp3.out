[00:00.000 --> 00:21.000]  When I think back on all the crap I learned in high school
[00:21.000 --> 00:26.000]  It's a wonder I can't think at all
[00:26.000 --> 00:34.000]  And though my lack of education hasn't hurt me none
[00:34.000 --> 00:39.000]  I can read the writing on the wall
[00:39.000 --> 00:46.000]  Kodachrome, it gives us those nice bright colors
[00:46.000 --> 00:49.000]  Gives us the greens of summers
[00:49.000 --> 00:55.000]  Makes you think all the words of a sunny day
[00:55.000 --> 01:00.000]  Oh yeah, I got an icon camera
[01:00.000 --> 01:03.000]  I love to take a photograph
[01:03.000 --> 01:10.000]  So mama don't take my Kodachrome away
[01:14.000 --> 01:22.000]  If you took all the girls I knew when I was single
[01:22.000 --> 01:28.000]  And brought them all together for one night
[01:28.000 --> 01:36.000]  I know they'd never match my sweet imagination
[01:36.000 --> 01:40.000]  And everything looks worse in black and white
[01:40.000 --> 01:47.000]  Kodachrome, it gives us those nice bright colors
[01:47.000 --> 01:50.000]  Gives us the greens of summers
[01:50.000 --> 01:55.000]  Makes you think all the words of a sunny day
[01:55.000 --> 02:00.000]  Oh yeah, I got an icon camera
[02:00.000 --> 02:04.000]  I love to take a photograph
[02:04.000 --> 02:10.000]  So mama don't take my Kodachrome away
[02:11.000 --> 02:17.000]  Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
[02:17.000 --> 02:23.000]  Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
[02:23.000 --> 02:33.000]  Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
[02:33.000 --> 02:38.000]  Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
[02:38.000 --> 02:46.000]  Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
[02:46.000 --> 02:48.000]  Leave your bars up off the phone
[02:48.000 --> 02:55.000]  Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
[02:55.000 --> 02:58.000]  Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
[03:25.000 --> 03:30.000]  Kodachrome
