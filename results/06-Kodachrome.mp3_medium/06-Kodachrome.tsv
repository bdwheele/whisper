0	21000	When I think back on all the crap I learned in high school
21000	26000	It's a wonder I can't think at all
26000	34000	And though my lack of education hasn't hurt me none
34000	39000	I can read the writing on the wall
39000	46000	Kodachrome, it gives us those nice bright colors
46000	49000	Gives us the greens of summers
49000	55000	Makes you think all the words of a sunny day
55000	60000	Oh yeah, I got an icon camera
60000	63000	I love to take a photograph
63000	70000	So mama don't take my Kodachrome away
74000	82000	If you took all the girls I knew when I was single
82000	88000	And brought them all together for one night
88000	96000	I know they'd never match my sweet imagination
96000	100000	And everything looks worse in black and white
100000	107000	Kodachrome, it gives us those nice bright colors
107000	110000	Gives us the greens of summers
110000	115000	Makes you think all the words of a sunny day
115000	120000	Oh yeah, I got an icon camera
120000	124000	I love to take a photograph
124000	130000	So mama don't take my Kodachrome away
131000	137000	Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
137000	143000	Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
143000	153000	Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
153000	158000	Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
158000	166000	Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
166000	168000	Leave your bars up off the phone
168000	175000	Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
175000	178000	Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
205000	210000	Kodachrome
