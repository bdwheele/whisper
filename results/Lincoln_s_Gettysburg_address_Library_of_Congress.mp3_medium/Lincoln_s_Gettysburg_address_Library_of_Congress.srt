1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The National Cemetery at Gettysburg was dedicated on November the 19th, 1863.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It commemorated the decisive battle of the Great Civil War, which had been fought there some four months earlier.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The oration of the day was delivered by the brilliant orator, Edward Everett, and occupied two hours.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:38,000
At its close, President Lincoln, with a few notes which he had penciled on the train while coming from Washington, spoke for barely three minutes.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The speech of Everett has been forgotten. The speech of Lincoln will be remembered until languages are dead and lips are dust.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It measures up to all of Daniel Webster's famous requirements that a great speech consists of three things, the man, the subject, and the occasion.

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
These are Lincoln's undying words.

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.

10
00:01:44,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live.

11
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground.

13
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract.

14
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.

15
00:02:48,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It is for us, the living, rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly acclaimed.

16
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us, that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they here gave the last full measure of devotion.

17
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:49,000
That we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from the earth.
