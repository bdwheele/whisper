0	6280	140 years ago today, President Abraham Lincoln stood at the site of one of the most important
6280	12080	battles of the U.S. Civil War in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. A crowd of some 15,000 had gathered
12080	17880	to consecrate a cemetery for Union war dead. Though brief, the now-famous Gettysburg Address
17880	23360	marked a defining moment of the Civil War. Actor Sam Waterston has portrayed President
23360	31240	Lincoln on stage and screen. Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth
31240	39720	on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition
39720	49960	that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether
49960	59440	that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met
59440	66720	on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as
66720	74960	a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It
74960	83600	is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate,
83600	92400	we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men living and dead who
92400	100960	struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. The world
101200	108480	will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.
108480	115960	It is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought
115960	123640	here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task
123760	132120	remaining before us, that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause
132120	141600	for which they gave the last full measure of devotion. That we here highly resolve that
141600	150600	these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth
150640	162240	of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish
162240	167720	from the earth. Actor Sam Waterston reading the Gettysburg Address delivered by President
167720	174120	Abraham Lincoln 140 years ago today. Waterston also is a leading member of the advisory committee
174120	179360	of the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission, which is charged with planning the celebration
179360	182280	of Lincoln's 200th birthday in 2009.
