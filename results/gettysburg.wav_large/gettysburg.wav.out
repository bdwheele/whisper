[00:00.000 --> 00:06.280]  140 years ago today, President Abraham Lincoln stood at the site of one of the most important
[00:06.280 --> 00:12.080]  battles of the U.S. Civil War in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. A crowd of some 15,000 had gathered
[00:12.080 --> 00:17.880]  to consecrate a cemetery for Union war dead. Though brief, the now-famous Gettysburg Address
[00:17.880 --> 00:23.360]  marked a defining moment of the Civil War. Actor Sam Waterston has portrayed President
[00:23.360 --> 00:31.240]  Lincoln on stage and screen. Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth
[00:31.240 --> 00:39.720]  on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition
[00:39.720 --> 00:49.960]  that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether
[00:49.960 --> 00:59.440]  that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met
[00:59.440 --> 01:06.720]  on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as
[01:06.720 --> 01:14.960]  a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It
[01:14.960 --> 01:23.600]  is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate,
[01:23.600 --> 01:32.400]  we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men living and dead who
[01:32.400 --> 01:40.960]  struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. The world
[01:41.200 --> 01:48.480]  will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.
[01:48.480 --> 01:55.960]  It is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought
[01:55.960 --> 02:03.640]  here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task
[02:03.760 --> 02:12.120]  remaining before us, that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause
[02:12.120 --> 02:21.600]  for which they gave the last full measure of devotion. That we here highly resolve that
[02:21.600 --> 02:30.600]  these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth
[02:30.640 --> 02:42.240]  of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish
[02:42.240 --> 02:47.720]  from the earth. Actor Sam Waterston reading the Gettysburg Address delivered by President
[02:47.720 --> 02:54.120]  Abraham Lincoln 140 years ago today. Waterston also is a leading member of the advisory committee
[02:54.120 --> 02:59.360]  of the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission, which is charged with planning the celebration
[02:59.360 --> 03:02.280]  of Lincoln's 200th birthday in 2009.
