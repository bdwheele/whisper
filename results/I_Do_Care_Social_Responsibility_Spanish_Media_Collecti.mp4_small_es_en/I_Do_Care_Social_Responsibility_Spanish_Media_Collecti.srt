1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This is a presentation of A.I.T.

2
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
A.I.T.

3
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
A.I.T.

4
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
A.I.T.

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Only for me.

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yes, I care.

7
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I.T.

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
A.I.T.

9
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
A.I.T.

10
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Throw second base, first base.

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What a race!

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What's the problem?

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You almost killed me.

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You've got her.

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Throw another base.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Forget it.

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Throw it hard.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,000


19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Let's go.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
That's the last one.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We must go to training.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What? It's your sister.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Hi, Alfie.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Do you like Edward's car?

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's very pretty.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Where did you get it?

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
How did I get it? I bought it.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Do you take me?

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I have to meet some friends. Do you want to come?

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Of course.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Alfredo, the training.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It'll be a bit late.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yes, it'll be late. Let's go.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
No, you only see if you want to.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
As you wish.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And you come?

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I can't.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
If I don't prepare dinner, my mom will kill me.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Why would she get mad at you? You're her baby.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Not if I don't prepare dinner.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Bye.

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Bye.

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What do you want me to tell the coach?

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Nothing. I won't need it.

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Kisses. You won't need it.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Of course. You won't need it.

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Very good. Give me a round.

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Then we'll play. Let's go.

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Hello, sir.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's late.

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm sorry. I had something to do.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Is there a problem?

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
No, none.

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Then why did you arrive late?

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I told you I had to do something.

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You also have the obligation to comply with our rules.

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
If you choose to arrive late,

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
you won't be able to continue playing.

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Good.

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
One moment, Alfredo.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You're the best player I have.

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I need you in the team.

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I want you to be the captain.

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Do you know what that means?

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yes.

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What?

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I want you to be more responsible.

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
That's right.

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Saturday we have a very important match.

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What kind of example will you give others

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
when you arrive late to train?

73
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I don't know.

74
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Do you think it's good?

75
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
No, I don't think so.

76
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Of course not.

77
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The rules are very important.

78
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
If you don't comply with them,

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
you don't only hurt yourself,

80
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
you also hurt others.

81
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Understood?

82
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yes, I'm sorry.

83
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I agree that it won't happen again.

84
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm going to run with the others.

85
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm just a little late.

86
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Hey, I'm already here.

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You arrived late.

88
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Where were you?

89
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We went for a walk.

90
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yes, yes.

91
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You know it's strict, right?

92
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yes, yes.

93
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yes, yes.

94
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You know it's strict,

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
you won't let me go out with you.

96
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
No.

97
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You know I love you.

98
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Of course I do.

99
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I have to cut.

100
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's back.

101
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Hello, mom.

102
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Hello, daughter.

103
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
How are you?

104
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Why in the plural?

105
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm fine.

106
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm sorry.

107
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Is Alfredo in training?

108
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I think so.

109
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Edward took him.

110
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Edward?

111
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
In what?

112
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
In his new car.

113
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Edward has a car?

114
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yes, he bought it today.

115
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And how did he pay it?

116
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
He works, mom.

117
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yes, in a car washroom.

118
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Why do you always distrust him?

119
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Because I don't trust him.

120
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And I don't want you to travel in his car.

121
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Why not?

122
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Because you're still very young.

123
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You never let me do anything.

124
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You left with your friends at 14 years old.

125
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yes, believe me, I paid for it.

126
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I never finished secondary school.

127
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But this is different.

128
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm sorry, honey.

129
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You'll have to wait for 16 years.

130
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You don't trust me, do you?

131
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Of course I trust you, little girl.

132
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I do trust you,

133
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
but that's the rule.

134
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And it's very important to me.

135
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Well, maybe it's your rule,

136
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
but it's a nonsense.

137
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
This girl is waiting for me.

138
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Teresa!

139
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Teresa Martinez, come here right now.

140
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Hello, mom.

141
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Is dinner ready?

142
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's in the kitchen.

143
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What did I do?

144
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Nothing, eat.

145
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So no one can go up to Edward's car?

146
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
No, but my sister says she'll go with him anyway.

147
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I don't know why mom imposes so many rules on us.

148
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
She's worried about you.

149
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Why? We don't know how to take care of ourselves.

150
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Are you sure your sister looks in love?

151
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yes, she's a Nazca, right?

152
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yes.

153
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And what do you want to do this afternoon?

154
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Edward will put a stereo to his car

155
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and I promised him to go through the sink to see it.

156
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
But I thought your mother said...

157
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
She said she couldn't go up to the car.

158
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm just going to see the stereo.

159
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Why don't you come?

160
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'd rather not go.

161
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Why?

162
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Mom doesn't want me to go there.

163
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Mom is the same, but how can she find out?

164
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I don't know.

165
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Stop thinking and let's go.

166
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I can't.

167
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Okay, I'll see you in practice.

168
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's time.

169
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
The coach is angry with you.

170
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I won't be long.

171
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm sorry, friend.

172
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I have to make a move.

173
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That's the deal.

174
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'll give you the rest when you give it to me.

175
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Okay.

176
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Okay.

177
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Okay.

178
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
We'll be good for tomorrow.

179
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Eight and a half.

180
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Okay.

181
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
We'll see each other.

182
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's time.

183
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
On the one hand, friend.

184
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What's wrong?

185
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Where do you get the money from?

186
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Hey, I'm a hard worker.

187
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Do you get paid so much here?

188
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Of course not.

189
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
But I have other jobs.

190
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What a luck.

191
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'd like to work.

192
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What would a kid like you do?

193
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I don't know.

194
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
All kinds of things.

195
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Don't tell me.

196
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Maybe he can help you.

197
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
How?

198
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You'll work for me.

199
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Can you start tomorrow afternoon?

200
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Of course.

201
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
After our game.

202
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Okay.

203
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Everything fixed.

204
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Thank you for joining us, Martínez.

205
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Thank you.

206
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It didn't help at all to talk about yesterday.

207
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Well, I thought it would take some time.

208
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Hurry up.

209
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You'll talk to Fernandez later.

210
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Sonny, you go after Alfredo.

211
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Okay.

212
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Okay.

213
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Bye.

214
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Bye.

215
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Bye.

216
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Bye.

217
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Bye.

218
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Bye.

219
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Bye.

220
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Bye.

221
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Bye.

222
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Bye.

223
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Bye.

224
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Bye.

225
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Bye.

226
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Bye.

227
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Bye.

228
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Bye.

229
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Bye.

230
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Bye.

231
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Bye.

232
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Bye.

233
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Bye.

234
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Bye.

235
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Bye.

236
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Bye.

237
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Bye.

238
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Bye.

239
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Bye.

240
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Bye.

241
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Bye.

242
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Bye.

243
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Bye.

244
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Bye.

245
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Bye.

246
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Bye.

247
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Bye.

248
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Bye.

249
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Bye.

250
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Bye.

251
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Bye.

252
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Bye.

253
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Bye bye.

254
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Bye.

255
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Bye then.

256
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,840
Bye.

257
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,840
Why?

258
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,840
Because we're talking about work.

259
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,840
How?

260
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,840
Edward gave me a job.

261
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,840
Doing what?

262
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,840
Handling packages.

263
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,840
What kind of packages?

264
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,840
I don't know.

265
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,840
He didn't tell me.

266
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,840
Hey, you shouldn't have accepted that.

267
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,840
You should have gotten into trouble.

268
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,840
It's not true.

269
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,840
Why are you so worried about what I'm doing?

270
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,840
You're my friend.

271
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,840
I don't want you to get into trouble.

272
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,840
Why do you say that?

273
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,840
You've changed.

274
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,840
It's not true.

275
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,840
If it is.

276
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,840
Martinez, it's your turn.

277
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,840
Stop worrying about me, okay?

278
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,840
Your mother will kill you.

279
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,840
I'm fine today.

280
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,840
Go!

281
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,840
Go!

282
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,840
Go!

283
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,840
Go!

284
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,840
Go!

285
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,840
Go!

286
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,840
Go!

287
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,840
Go!

288
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,840
Go!

289
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,840
Go!

290
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,840
Go!

291
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,840
Go!

292
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,840
Go!

293
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,840
Go!

294
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,840
Let's go, Mom!

295
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,840
It's late.

296
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,840
Your sister hasn't come back.

297
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,840
I told her to come back before 11.

298
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,840
We can't wait.

299
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,840
I have to get there in time.

300
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,840
I'll give her a few more minutes.

301
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,840
Mom, it's an important match.

302
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,840
I promised to stay there.

303
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,840
Let's go.

304
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,840
And you'll be successful.

305
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,840
I'll try, Mom.

306
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,840
But you have so many rules.

307
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,840
You are my life.

308
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,840
I only have rules to avoid problems.

309
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,840
Nothing will happen to you.

310
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,840
I don't think so, Mom.

311
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,840
Let's go.

312
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,840
Okay, Alfredo.

313
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,840
Leave a note and tell her we'll be in the park.

314
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,840
I'll bring my keys.

315
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,840
Please, Mom.

316
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,840
We have to go.

317
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,840
I'm moving as fast as I can, son.

318
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,840
I'll be there in time.

319
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,840
Don't rush me, please.

320
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,840
Good.

321
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,840
Alfredo!

322
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,840
Have you forgotten something?

323
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,840
Thank you.

324
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,840
THE END

325
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,840
It was time you arrived.

326
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,840
Are you late?

327
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,840
Not yet, but they're about to start practicing.

328
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,840
It was my sister's fault. She didn't come home.

329
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,840
Let's go!

330
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,840
Thank you.

331
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,840
Yes!

332
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,840
Bravo!

333
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,840
Well done!

334
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,840
Alfredo, thank you.

335
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,840
That's it!

336
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,840
Very good, Alfredo.

337
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,840
That's how you do it.

338
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,840
I remember, guys. Come here.

339
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,840
Your positions are on the list.

340
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,840
Check them out and get ready to take them

341
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,840
as soon as the other team leaves, okay?

342
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,840
Are you at the bank?

343
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,840
You too.

344
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,840
I'm always there.

345
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,840
Hey, where are you going now?

346
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,840
Let's see what's going on.

347
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,840
Sir.

348
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,840
Yes?

349
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,840
I'm not playing today.

350
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,840
Well, today you'll play as an entry.

351
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,840
Why?

352
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,840
You know the rules.

353
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,840
If you don't practice, you don't play.

354
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,840
You can't do it.

355
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,840
Oh, no!

356
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,840
They're the rules.

357
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,840
You'll only play as an entry in the right garden.

358
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,840
Understood?

359
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,840
But I'm a very good player.

360
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,840
This game is important.

361
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,840
It's true.

362
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,840
I need you to play.

363
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,840
But there are many guys who have come

364
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,840
every day in time.

365
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,840
And they get really angry.

366
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,840
It wouldn't be fair for them not to let them play.

367
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,840
But they want you to play.

368
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,840
And if we lose?

369
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,840
If we lose, we lose.

370
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,840
When one does wrong things,

371
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,840
it hurts everyone.

372
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,840
It's not fair.

373
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,840
Well, I'll tell you something.

374
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,840
It'll be better if you get used to it, Alfredo,

375
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,840
because you'll have to respect

376
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,840
all your life rules.

377
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,840
Now let's go to the attack.

378
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,840
Go sit down.

379
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,840
Okay.

380
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,840
Cheer your team up from the bench.

381
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,840
Let's go.

382
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,840
Are you going to play?

383
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,840
Just one entry.

384
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,840
We'll lose.

385
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,840
I'm sorry.

386
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,840
I broke the rules.

387
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,840
That's terrible.

388
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,840
They won't lose.

389
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,840
I'm looking for Mrs. Silvia Martinez.

390
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,840
Silvia Martinez?

391
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,840
Yes, I'm Silvia Martinez.

392
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,840
I'm sorry to alarm her.

393
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,840
Can you come with me?

394
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,840
What happened?

395
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,840
It's her daughter.

396
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,840
Teresa, what did she do?

397
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,840
Where is she?

398
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,840
Mom, I'm sorry.

399
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,840
Teresa, what happened?

400
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,840
Eduard.

401
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,840
Eduard, what were you doing with Eduard?

402
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,840
Listen to me, Mom.

403
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,840
They hurt him.

404
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,840
The man who was with her daughter sold drugs.

405
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,840
Drugs?

406
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,840
Is Eduard dead?

407
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,840
No, but his car was destroyed.

408
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,840
He has a drug problem.

409
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,840
I didn't know anything about drugs, Mom.

410
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,840
I swear.

411
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,840
We believe your daughter is telling the truth, Mrs. Martinez.

412
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,840
We've been watching that young man for a long time.

413
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,840
You'll work for me.

414
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,840
Can you start tomorrow?

415
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,840
Of course.

416
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,840
After my game.

417
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,840
Okay, everything is fixed.

418
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,840
Eduard gave me a job.

419
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,840
Doing what?

420
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,840
Sending packages.

421
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,840
What kind of packages?

422
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,840
I don't know.

423
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,840
He didn't tell me.

424
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,840
But they want me to play.

425
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,840
What if we lose?

426
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,840
What if we lose?

427
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,840
We lose.

428
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,840
When you do bad things,

429
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,840
you hurt others.

430
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,840
I don't understand why you don't listen to me.

431
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,840
I try.

432
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,840
But you have so many rules.

433
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,840
You are my life.

434
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,840
I have rules to avoid problems.

435
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,840
Why do you worry so much about me?

436
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,840
You are my friend.

437
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,840
And I don't want you to get into trouble.

438
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,840
Alfredo.

439
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,840
Alfredo.

440
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,840
Alfredo.

441
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,840
Yes, Mom.

442
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,840
Stay with Sonia until we come back, okay?

443
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,840
Okay.

444
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,840
No matter what happens, Mom.

445
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,840
Yes, it's true.

446
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,840
Only for me.

447
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,840
To be continued...
