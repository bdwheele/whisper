95000	96000	What a race!
96000	97000	What's the problem?
97000	98000	You almost killed me.
98000	99000	You've got her.
99000	100000	Throw another base.
102000	103000	Forget it.
103000	104000	Throw it hard.
104000	104000	
105000	106000	Let's go.
106000	107000	That's the last one.
107000	109000	We must go to training.
112000	114000	What? It's your sister.
116000	117000	Hi, Alfie.
117000	119000	Do you like Edward's car?
119000	120000	It's very pretty.
120000	121000	Where did you get it?
121000	123000	How did I get it? I bought it.
123000	124000	Do you take me?
124000	126000	I have to meet some friends. Do you want to come?
126000	127000	Of course.
128000	130000	Alfredo, the training.
130000	131000	It'll be a bit late.
131000	133000	Yes, it'll be late. Let's go.
133000	135000	No, you only see if you want to.
135000	136000	As you wish.
136000	137000	And you come?
137000	138000	I can't.
138000	140000	If I don't prepare dinner, my mom will kill me.
140000	143000	Why would she get mad at you? You're her baby.
143000	145000	Not if I don't prepare dinner.
148000	149000	Bye.
149000	150000	Bye.
150000	152000	What do you want me to tell the coach?
152000	153000	Nothing. I won't need it.
153000	155000	Kisses. You won't need it.
161000	163000	Of course. You won't need it.
170000	177000	3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
177000	179000	Very good. Give me a round.
179000	181000	Then we'll play. Let's go.
181000	182000	Hello, sir.
182000	183000	It's late.
183000	185000	I'm sorry. I had something to do.
185000	186000	Is there a problem?
186000	187000	No, none.
187000	188000	Then why did you arrive late?
188000	190000	I told you I had to do something.
190000	193000	You also have the obligation to comply with our rules.
193000	195000	If you choose to arrive late,
195000	197000	you won't be able to continue playing.
197000	198000	Good.
198000	199000	One moment, Alfredo.
201000	203000	You're the best player I have.
203000	205000	I need you in the team.
205000	206000	I want you to be the captain.
206000	208000	Do you know what that means?
208000	209000	Yes.
209000	210000	What?
210000	211000	I want you to be more responsible.
211000	212000	That's right.
212000	214000	Saturday we have a very important match.
214000	216000	What kind of example will you give others
216000	217000	when you arrive late to train?
217000	218000	I don't know.
218000	219000	Do you think it's good?
219000	221000	No, I don't think so.
221000	222000	Of course not.
222000	224000	The rules are very important.
224000	225000	If you don't comply with them,
225000	226000	you don't only hurt yourself,
226000	227000	you also hurt others.
227000	228000	Understood?
228000	230000	Yes, I'm sorry.
230000	232000	I agree that it won't happen again.
232000	234000	I'm going to run with the others.
236000	238000	I'm just a little late.
238000	239000	Hey, I'm already here.
239000	240000	You arrived late.
240000	241000	Where were you?
241000	242000	We went for a walk.
248000	249000	Yes, yes.
249000	250000	You know it's strict, right?
250000	251000	Yes, yes.
252000	253000	Yes, yes.
253000	254000	You know it's strict,
254000	256000	you won't let me go out with you.
256000	257000	No.
257000	258000	You know I love you.
258000	259000	Of course I do.
260000	261000	I have to cut.
261000	262000	It's back.
263000	264000	Hello, mom.
264000	265000	Hello, daughter.
265000	266000	How are you?
266000	267000	Why in the plural?
267000	268000	I'm fine.
268000	269000	I'm sorry.
269000	270000	Is Alfredo in training?
270000	271000	I think so.
271000	272000	Edward took him.
272000	273000	Edward?
273000	274000	In what?
274000	275000	In his new car.
275000	276000	Edward has a car?
276000	277000	Yes, he bought it today.
277000	278000	And how did he pay it?
278000	280000	He works, mom.
280000	281000	Yes, in a car washroom.
281000	283000	Why do you always distrust him?
283000	284000	Because I don't trust him.
284000	286000	And I don't want you to travel in his car.
286000	287000	Why not?
287000	288000	Because you're still very young.
288000	289000	You never let me do anything.
289000	291000	You left with your friends at 14 years old.
291000	293000	Yes, believe me, I paid for it.
293000	294000	I never finished secondary school.
294000	296000	But this is different.
296000	297000	I'm sorry, honey.
297000	299000	You'll have to wait for 16 years.
299000	301000	You don't trust me, do you?
301000	303000	Of course I trust you, little girl.
303000	304000	I do trust you,
304000	305000	but that's the rule.
305000	307000	And it's very important to me.
307000	309000	Well, maybe it's your rule,
309000	310000	but it's a nonsense.
310000	312000	This girl is waiting for me.
312000	313000	Teresa!
313000	315000	Teresa Martinez, come here right now.
316000	317000	Hello, mom.
317000	318000	Is dinner ready?
318000	319000	It's in the kitchen.
319000	320000	What did I do?
320000	321000	Nothing, eat.
327000	330000	So no one can go up to Edward's car?
330000	333000	No, but my sister says she'll go with him anyway.
333000	335000	I don't know why mom imposes so many rules on us.
335000	337000	She's worried about you.
337000	339000	Why? We don't know how to take care of ourselves.
339000	342000	Are you sure your sister looks in love?
342000	343000	Yes, she's a Nazca, right?
343000	344000	Yes.
344000	346000	And what do you want to do this afternoon?
346000	348000	Edward will put a stereo to his car
348000	350000	and I promised him to go through the sink to see it.
350000	351000	But I thought your mother said...
351000	353000	She said she couldn't go up to the car.
353000	354000	I'm just going to see the stereo.
354000	355000	Why don't you come?
355000	356000	I'd rather not go.
356000	357000	Why?
357000	359000	Mom doesn't want me to go there.
359000	361000	Mom is the same, but how can she find out?
361000	362000	I don't know.
362000	364000	Stop thinking and let's go.
364000	365000	I can't.
365000	367000	Okay, I'll see you in practice.
367000	369000	It's time.
369000	371000	The coach is angry with you.
371000	372000	I won't be long.
387000	388000	I'm sorry, friend.
388000	390000	I have to make a move.
391000	392000	That's the deal.
392000	394000	I'll give you the rest when you give it to me.
394000	395000	Okay.
395000	396000	Okay.
396000	397000	Okay.
397000	398000	We'll be good for tomorrow.
398000	399000	Eight and a half.
399000	400000	Okay.
400000	401000	We'll see each other.
401000	402000	It's time.
403000	405000	On the one hand, friend.
406000	407000	What's wrong?
407000	409000	Where do you get the money from?
409000	410000	Hey, I'm a hard worker.
410000	412000	Do you get paid so much here?
412000	413000	Of course not.
413000	414000	But I have other jobs.
414000	415000	What a luck.
415000	416000	I'd like to work.
416000	418000	What would a kid like you do?
418000	419000	I don't know.
419000	420000	All kinds of things.
420000	421000	Don't tell me.
421000	423000	Maybe he can help you.
423000	424000	How?
424000	425000	You'll work for me.
425000	426000	Can you start tomorrow afternoon?
426000	427000	Of course.
427000	429000	After our game.
429000	430000	Okay.
430000	431000	Everything fixed.
431000	433000	Thank you for joining us, Mart√≠nez.
433000	434000	Thank you.
434000	436000	It didn't help at all to talk about yesterday.
436000	438000	Well, I thought it would take some time.
438000	439000	Hurry up.
439000	440000	You'll talk to Fernandez later.
440000	443000	Sonny, you go after Alfredo.
443000	444000	Okay.
444000	445000	Okay.

486000	487000	Bye.
487000	488000	Bye then.
488000	488840	Bye.
488840	489840	Why?
489840	490840	Because we're talking about work.
490840	491840	How?
491840	492840	Edward gave me a job.
492840	493840	Doing what?
493840	494840	Handling packages.
494840	496840	What kind of packages?
496840	497840	I don't know.
497840	498840	He didn't tell me.
498840	499840	Hey, you shouldn't have accepted that.
499840	500840	You should have gotten into trouble.
500840	501840	It's not true.
501840	503840	Why are you so worried about what I'm doing?
503840	504840	You're my friend.
504840	506840	I don't want you to get into trouble.
506840	507840	Why do you say that?
507840	508840	You've changed.
508840	509840	It's not true.
509840	510840	If it is.
510840	511840	Martinez, it's your turn.
511840	514840	Stop worrying about me, okay?
514840	517840	Your mother will kill you.
517840	518840	I'm fine today.
518840	519840	Go!
519840	520840	Go!
520840	521840	Go!
521840	522840	Go!
522840	523840	Go!
523840	524840	Go!
524840	525840	Go!
525840	526840	Go!
526840	527840	Go!
527840	528840	Go!
528840	529840	Go!
529840	530840	Go!
530840	531840	Go!
531840	532840	Go!
532840	533840	Let's go, Mom!
533840	534840	It's late.
534840	535840	Your sister hasn't come back.
535840	537840	I told her to come back before 11.
537840	538840	We can't wait.
538840	540840	I have to get there in time.
540840	542840	I'll give her a few more minutes.
542840	543840	Mom, it's an important match.
543840	544840	I promised to stay there.
544840	545840	Let's go.
545840	546840	And you'll be successful.
546840	547840	I'll try, Mom.
547840	549840	But you have so many rules.
549840	550840	You are my life.
550840	552840	I only have rules to avoid problems.
552840	554840	Nothing will happen to you.
554840	555840	I don't think so, Mom.
555840	556840	Let's go.
556840	557840	Okay, Alfredo.
557840	559840	Leave a note and tell her we'll be in the park.
559840	561840	I'll bring my keys.
566840	567840	Please, Mom.
567840	568840	We have to go.
568840	570840	I'm moving as fast as I can, son.
570840	572840	I'll be there in time.
572840	574840	Don't rush me, please.
576840	577840	Good.
598840	599840	Alfredo!
599840	601840	Have you forgotten something?
601840	602840	Thank you.
607840	609840	THE END
611840	613840	It was time you arrived.
613840	614840	Are you late?
614840	617840	Not yet, but they're about to start practicing.
617840	619840	It was my sister's fault. She didn't come home.
619840	620840	Let's go!
637840	638840	Thank you.
639840	640840	Yes!
640840	641840	Bravo!
645840	647840	Well done!
648840	649840	Alfredo, thank you.
649840	650840	That's it!
650840	652840	Very good, Alfredo.
652840	653840	That's how you do it.
659840	661840	I remember, guys. Come here.
661840	663840	Your positions are on the list.
663840	665840	Check them out and get ready to take them
665840	667840	as soon as the other team leaves, okay?
673840	674840	Are you at the bank?
674840	675840	You too.
675840	677840	I'm always there.
677840	679840	Hey, where are you going now?
679840	681840	Let's see what's going on.
683840	684840	Sir.
684840	685840	Yes?
685840	686840	I'm not playing today.
686840	688840	Well, today you'll play as an entry.
688840	689840	Why?
689840	690840	You know the rules.
690840	692840	If you don't practice, you don't play.
692840	693840	You can't do it.
693840	694840	Oh, no!
694840	696840	They're the rules.
696840	699840	You'll only play as an entry in the right garden.
699840	700840	Understood?
700840	701840	But I'm a very good player.
701840	702840	This game is important.
702840	703840	It's true.
703840	704840	I need you to play.
704840	706840	But there are many guys who have come
706840	707840	every day in time.
707840	709840	And they get really angry.
709840	711840	It wouldn't be fair for them not to let them play.
711840	712840	But they want you to play.
712840	713840	And if we lose?
713840	715840	If we lose, we lose.
715840	717840	When one does wrong things,
717840	718840	it hurts everyone.
718840	719840	It's not fair.
719840	720840	Well, I'll tell you something.
720840	722840	It'll be better if you get used to it, Alfredo,
722840	723840	because you'll have to respect
723840	725840	all your life rules.
725840	727840	Now let's go to the attack.
727840	728840	Go sit down.
728840	729840	Okay.
729840	731840	Cheer your team up from the bench.
731840	732840	Let's go.
733840	735840	Are you going to play?
735840	736840	Just one entry.
736840	737840	We'll lose.
737840	738840	I'm sorry.
738840	739840	I broke the rules.
739840	740840	That's terrible.
740840	741840	They won't lose.
741840	743840	I'm looking for Mrs. Silvia Martinez.
743840	744840	Silvia Martinez?
744840	746840	Yes, I'm Silvia Martinez.
746840	748840	I'm sorry to alarm her.
748840	749840	Can you come with me?
749840	750840	What happened?
750840	751840	It's her daughter.
751840	752840	Teresa, what did she do?
752840	753840	Where is she?
756840	757840	Mom, I'm sorry.
757840	759840	Teresa, what happened?
759840	760840	Eduard.
760840	762840	Eduard, what were you doing with Eduard?
762840	763840	Listen to me, Mom.
763840	764840	They hurt him.
764840	766840	The man who was with her daughter sold drugs.
766840	767840	Drugs?
767840	768840	Is Eduard dead?
768840	770840	No, but his car was destroyed.
770840	772840	He has a drug problem.
772840	774840	I didn't know anything about drugs, Mom.
774840	775840	I swear.
775840	777840	We believe your daughter is telling the truth, Mrs. Martinez.
777840	780840	We've been watching that young man for a long time.
782840	783840	You'll work for me.
783840	784840	Can you start tomorrow?
784840	785840	Of course.
785840	787840	After my game.
787840	788840	Okay, everything is fixed.
788840	789840	Eduard gave me a job.
789840	790840	Doing what?
790840	791840	Sending packages.
791840	793840	What kind of packages?
793840	794840	I don't know.
794840	795840	He didn't tell me.
795840	796840	But they want me to play.
796840	797840	What if we lose?
797840	798840	What if we lose?
798840	799840	We lose.
799840	800840	When you do bad things,
800840	801840	you hurt others.
801840	803840	I don't understand why you don't listen to me.
803840	804840	I try.
804840	806840	But you have so many rules.
806840	808840	You are my life.
808840	810840	I have rules to avoid problems.
810840	812840	Why do you worry so much about me?
812840	813840	You are my friend.
813840	815840	And I don't want you to get into trouble.
815840	817840	Alfredo.
818840	819840	Alfredo.
819840	820840	Alfredo.
820840	821840	Yes, Mom.
821840	823840	Stay with Sonia until we come back, okay?
824840	825840	Okay.
825840	827840	No matter what happens, Mom.
827840	829840	Yes, it's true.
834840	836840	Only for me.
864840	866840	To be continued...
