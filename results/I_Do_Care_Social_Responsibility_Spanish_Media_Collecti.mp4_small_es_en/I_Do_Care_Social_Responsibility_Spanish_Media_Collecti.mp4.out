[00:30.000 --> 00:54.000]  This is a presentation of A.I.T.
[01:01.000 --> 01:02.000]  A.I.T.
[01:03.000 --> 01:04.000]  A.I.T.
[01:07.000 --> 01:08.000]  A.I.T.
[01:10.000 --> 01:14.000]  Only for me.
[01:20.000 --> 01:22.000]  Yes, I care.
[01:22.000 --> 01:23.000]  I.T.
[01:28.000 --> 01:29.000]  A.I.T.
[01:33.000 --> 01:34.000]  A.I.T.
[01:34.000 --> 01:35.000]  Throw second base, first base.
[01:35.000 --> 01:36.000]  What a race!
[01:36.000 --> 01:37.000]  What's the problem?
[01:37.000 --> 01:38.000]  You almost killed me.
[01:38.000 --> 01:39.000]  You've got her.
[01:39.000 --> 01:40.000]  Throw another base.
[01:42.000 --> 01:43.000]  Forget it.
[01:43.000 --> 01:44.000]  Throw it hard.
[01:44.000 --> 01:44.000]  I'll be smoother.
[01:45.000 --> 01:46.000]  Let's go.
[01:46.000 --> 01:47.000]  That's the last one.
[01:47.000 --> 01:49.000]  We must go to training.
[01:52.000 --> 01:54.000]  What? It's your sister.
[01:56.000 --> 01:57.000]  Hi, Alfie.
[01:57.000 --> 01:59.000]  Do you like Edward's car?
[01:59.000 --> 02:00.000]  It's very pretty.
[02:00.000 --> 02:01.000]  Where did you get it?
[02:01.000 --> 02:03.000]  How did I get it? I bought it.
[02:03.000 --> 02:04.000]  Do you take me?
[02:04.000 --> 02:06.000]  I have to meet some friends. Do you want to come?
[02:06.000 --> 02:07.000]  Of course.
[02:08.000 --> 02:10.000]  Alfredo, the training.
[02:10.000 --> 02:11.000]  It'll be a bit late.
[02:11.000 --> 02:13.000]  Yes, it'll be late. Let's go.
[02:13.000 --> 02:15.000]  No, you only see if you want to.
[02:15.000 --> 02:16.000]  As you wish.
[02:16.000 --> 02:17.000]  And you come?
[02:17.000 --> 02:18.000]  I can't.
[02:18.000 --> 02:20.000]  If I don't prepare dinner, my mom will kill me.
[02:20.000 --> 02:23.000]  Why would she get mad at you? You're her baby.
[02:23.000 --> 02:25.000]  Not if I don't prepare dinner.
[02:28.000 --> 02:29.000]  Bye.
[02:29.000 --> 02:30.000]  Bye.
[02:30.000 --> 02:32.000]  What do you want me to tell the coach?
[02:32.000 --> 02:33.000]  Nothing. I won't need it.
[02:33.000 --> 02:35.000]  Kisses. You won't need it.
[02:41.000 --> 02:43.000]  Of course. You won't need it.
[02:50.000 --> 02:57.000]  3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[02:57.000 --> 02:59.000]  Very good. Give me a round.
[02:59.000 --> 03:01.000]  Then we'll play. Let's go.
[03:01.000 --> 03:02.000]  Hello, sir.
[03:02.000 --> 03:03.000]  It's late.
[03:03.000 --> 03:05.000]  I'm sorry. I had something to do.
[03:05.000 --> 03:06.000]  Is there a problem?
[03:06.000 --> 03:07.000]  No, none.
[03:07.000 --> 03:08.000]  Then why did you arrive late?
[03:08.000 --> 03:10.000]  I told you I had to do something.
[03:10.000 --> 03:13.000]  You also have the obligation to comply with our rules.
[03:13.000 --> 03:15.000]  If you choose to arrive late,
[03:15.000 --> 03:17.000]  you won't be able to continue playing.
[03:17.000 --> 03:18.000]  Good.
[03:18.000 --> 03:19.000]  One moment, Alfredo.
[03:21.000 --> 03:23.000]  You're the best player I have.
[03:23.000 --> 03:25.000]  I need you in the team.
[03:25.000 --> 03:26.000]  I want you to be the captain.
[03:26.000 --> 03:28.000]  Do you know what that means?
[03:28.000 --> 03:29.000]  Yes.
[03:29.000 --> 03:30.000]  What?
[03:30.000 --> 03:31.000]  I want you to be more responsible.
[03:31.000 --> 03:32.000]  That's right.
[03:32.000 --> 03:34.000]  Saturday we have a very important match.
[03:34.000 --> 03:36.000]  What kind of example will you give others
[03:36.000 --> 03:37.000]  when you arrive late to train?
[03:37.000 --> 03:38.000]  I don't know.
[03:38.000 --> 03:39.000]  Do you think it's good?
[03:39.000 --> 03:41.000]  No, I don't think so.
[03:41.000 --> 03:42.000]  Of course not.
[03:42.000 --> 03:44.000]  The rules are very important.
[03:44.000 --> 03:45.000]  If you don't comply with them,
[03:45.000 --> 03:46.000]  you don't only hurt yourself,
[03:46.000 --> 03:47.000]  you also hurt others.
[03:47.000 --> 03:48.000]  Understood?
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.000]  Yes, I'm sorry.
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.000]  I agree that it won't happen again.
[03:52.000 --> 03:54.000]  I'm going to run with the others.
[03:56.000 --> 03:58.000]  I'm just a little late.
[03:58.000 --> 03:59.000]  Hey, I'm already here.
[03:59.000 --> 04:00.000]  You arrived late.
[04:00.000 --> 04:01.000]  Where were you?
[04:01.000 --> 04:02.000]  We went for a walk.
[04:08.000 --> 04:09.000]  Yes, yes.
[04:09.000 --> 04:10.000]  You know it's strict, right?
[04:10.000 --> 04:11.000]  Yes, yes.
[04:12.000 --> 04:13.000]  Yes, yes.
[04:13.000 --> 04:14.000]  You know it's strict,
[04:14.000 --> 04:16.000]  you won't let me go out with you.
[04:16.000 --> 04:17.000]  No.
[04:17.000 --> 04:18.000]  You know I love you.
[04:18.000 --> 04:19.000]  Of course I do.
[04:20.000 --> 04:21.000]  I have to cut.
[04:21.000 --> 04:22.000]  It's back.
[04:23.000 --> 04:24.000]  Hello, mom.
[04:24.000 --> 04:25.000]  Hello, daughter.
[04:25.000 --> 04:26.000]  How are you?
[04:26.000 --> 04:27.000]  Why in the plural?
[04:27.000 --> 04:28.000]  I'm fine.
[04:28.000 --> 04:29.000]  I'm sorry.
[04:29.000 --> 04:30.000]  Is Alfredo in training?
[04:30.000 --> 04:31.000]  I think so.
[04:31.000 --> 04:32.000]  Edward took him.
[04:32.000 --> 04:33.000]  Edward?
[04:33.000 --> 04:34.000]  In what?
[04:34.000 --> 04:35.000]  In his new car.
[04:35.000 --> 04:36.000]  Edward has a car?
[04:36.000 --> 04:37.000]  Yes, he bought it today.
[04:37.000 --> 04:38.000]  And how did he pay it?
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.000]  He works, mom.
[04:40.000 --> 04:41.000]  Yes, in a car washroom.
[04:41.000 --> 04:43.000]  Why do you always distrust him?
[04:43.000 --> 04:44.000]  Because I don't trust him.
[04:44.000 --> 04:46.000]  And I don't want you to travel in his car.
[04:46.000 --> 04:47.000]  Why not?
[04:47.000 --> 04:48.000]  Because you're still very young.
[04:48.000 --> 04:49.000]  You never let me do anything.
[04:49.000 --> 04:51.000]  You left with your friends at 14 years old.
[04:51.000 --> 04:53.000]  Yes, believe me, I paid for it.
[04:53.000 --> 04:54.000]  I never finished secondary school.
[04:54.000 --> 04:56.000]  But this is different.
[04:56.000 --> 04:57.000]  I'm sorry, honey.
[04:57.000 --> 04:59.000]  You'll have to wait for 16 years.
[04:59.000 --> 05:01.000]  You don't trust me, do you?
[05:01.000 --> 05:03.000]  Of course I trust you, little girl.
[05:03.000 --> 05:04.000]  I do trust you,
[05:04.000 --> 05:05.000]  but that's the rule.
[05:05.000 --> 05:07.000]  And it's very important to me.
[05:07.000 --> 05:09.000]  Well, maybe it's your rule,
[05:09.000 --> 05:10.000]  but it's a nonsense.
[05:10.000 --> 05:12.000]  This girl is waiting for me.
[05:12.000 --> 05:13.000]  Teresa!
[05:13.000 --> 05:15.000]  Teresa Martinez, come here right now.
[05:16.000 --> 05:17.000]  Hello, mom.
[05:17.000 --> 05:18.000]  Is dinner ready?
[05:18.000 --> 05:19.000]  It's in the kitchen.
[05:19.000 --> 05:20.000]  What did I do?
[05:20.000 --> 05:21.000]  Nothing, eat.
[05:27.000 --> 05:30.000]  So no one can go up to Edward's car?
[05:30.000 --> 05:33.000]  No, but my sister says she'll go with him anyway.
[05:33.000 --> 05:35.000]  I don't know why mom imposes so many rules on us.
[05:35.000 --> 05:37.000]  She's worried about you.
[05:37.000 --> 05:39.000]  Why? We don't know how to take care of ourselves.
[05:39.000 --> 05:42.000]  Are you sure your sister looks in love?
[05:42.000 --> 05:43.000]  Yes, she's a Nazca, right?
[05:43.000 --> 05:44.000]  Yes.
[05:44.000 --> 05:46.000]  And what do you want to do this afternoon?
[05:46.000 --> 05:48.000]  Edward will put a stereo to his car
[05:48.000 --> 05:50.000]  and I promised him to go through the sink to see it.
[05:50.000 --> 05:51.000]  But I thought your mother said...
[05:51.000 --> 05:53.000]  She said she couldn't go up to the car.
[05:53.000 --> 05:54.000]  I'm just going to see the stereo.
[05:54.000 --> 05:55.000]  Why don't you come?
[05:55.000 --> 05:56.000]  I'd rather not go.
[05:56.000 --> 05:57.000]  Why?
[05:57.000 --> 05:59.000]  Mom doesn't want me to go there.
[05:59.000 --> 06:01.000]  Mom is the same, but how can she find out?
[06:01.000 --> 06:02.000]  I don't know.
[06:02.000 --> 06:04.000]  Stop thinking and let's go.
[06:04.000 --> 06:05.000]  I can't.
[06:05.000 --> 06:07.000]  Okay, I'll see you in practice.
[06:07.000 --> 06:09.000]  It's time.
[06:09.000 --> 06:11.000]  The coach is angry with you.
[06:11.000 --> 06:12.000]  I won't be long.
[06:27.000 --> 06:28.000]  I'm sorry, friend.
[06:28.000 --> 06:30.000]  I have to make a move.
[06:31.000 --> 06:32.000]  That's the deal.
[06:32.000 --> 06:34.000]  I'll give you the rest when you give it to me.
[06:34.000 --> 06:35.000]  Okay.
[06:35.000 --> 06:36.000]  Okay.
[06:36.000 --> 06:37.000]  Okay.
[06:37.000 --> 06:38.000]  We'll be good for tomorrow.
[06:38.000 --> 06:39.000]  Eight and a half.
[06:39.000 --> 06:40.000]  Okay.
[06:40.000 --> 06:41.000]  We'll see each other.
[06:41.000 --> 06:42.000]  It's time.
[06:43.000 --> 06:45.000]  On the one hand, friend.
[06:46.000 --> 06:47.000]  What's wrong?
[06:47.000 --> 06:49.000]  Where do you get the money from?
[06:49.000 --> 06:50.000]  Hey, I'm a hard worker.
[06:50.000 --> 06:52.000]  Do you get paid so much here?
[06:52.000 --> 06:53.000]  Of course not.
[06:53.000 --> 06:54.000]  But I have other jobs.
[06:54.000 --> 06:55.000]  What a luck.
[06:55.000 --> 06:56.000]  I'd like to work.
[06:56.000 --> 06:58.000]  What would a kid like you do?
[06:58.000 --> 06:59.000]  I don't know.
[06:59.000 --> 07:00.000]  All kinds of things.
[07:00.000 --> 07:01.000]  Don't tell me.
[07:01.000 --> 07:03.000]  Maybe he can help you.
[07:03.000 --> 07:04.000]  How?
[07:04.000 --> 07:05.000]  You'll work for me.
[07:05.000 --> 07:06.000]  Can you start tomorrow afternoon?
[07:06.000 --> 07:07.000]  Of course.
[07:07.000 --> 07:09.000]  After our game.
[07:09.000 --> 07:10.000]  Okay.
[07:10.000 --> 07:11.000]  Everything fixed.
[07:11.000 --> 07:13.000]  Thank you for joining us, Martínez.
[07:13.000 --> 07:14.000]  Thank you.
[07:14.000 --> 07:16.000]  It didn't help at all to talk about yesterday.
[07:16.000 --> 07:18.000]  Well, I thought it would take some time.
[07:18.000 --> 07:19.000]  Hurry up.
[07:19.000 --> 07:20.000]  You'll talk to Fernandez later.
[07:20.000 --> 07:23.000]  Sonny, you go after Alfredo.
[07:23.000 --> 07:24.000]  Okay.
[07:24.000 --> 07:25.000]  Okay.
[07:25.000 --> 07:26.000]  Bye.
[07:26.000 --> 07:27.000]  Bye.
[07:27.000 --> 07:28.000]  Bye.
[07:28.000 --> 07:29.000]  Bye.

[08:03.000 --> 08:04.000]  Bye.
[08:04.000 --> 08:05.000]  Bye.
[08:05.000 --> 08:06.000]  Bye bye.
[08:06.000 --> 08:07.000]  Bye.
[08:07.000 --> 08:08.000]  Bye then.
[08:08.000 --> 08:08.840]  Bye.
[08:08.840 --> 08:09.840]  Why?
[08:09.840 --> 08:10.840]  Because we're talking about work.
[08:10.840 --> 08:11.840]  How?
[08:11.840 --> 08:12.840]  Edward gave me a job.
[08:12.840 --> 08:13.840]  Doing what?
[08:13.840 --> 08:14.840]  Handling packages.
[08:14.840 --> 08:16.840]  What kind of packages?
[08:16.840 --> 08:17.840]  I don't know.
[08:17.840 --> 08:18.840]  He didn't tell me.
[08:18.840 --> 08:19.840]  Hey, you shouldn't have accepted that.
[08:19.840 --> 08:20.840]  You should have gotten into trouble.
[08:20.840 --> 08:21.840]  It's not true.
[08:21.840 --> 08:23.840]  Why are you so worried about what I'm doing?
[08:23.840 --> 08:24.840]  You're my friend.
[08:24.840 --> 08:26.840]  I don't want you to get into trouble.
[08:26.840 --> 08:27.840]  Why do you say that?
[08:27.840 --> 08:28.840]  You've changed.
[08:28.840 --> 08:29.840]  It's not true.
[08:29.840 --> 08:30.840]  If it is.
[08:30.840 --> 08:31.840]  Martinez, it's your turn.
[08:31.840 --> 08:34.840]  Stop worrying about me, okay?
[08:34.840 --> 08:37.840]  Your mother will kill you.
[08:37.840 --> 08:38.840]  I'm fine today.
[08:38.840 --> 08:39.840]  Go!
[08:39.840 --> 08:40.840]  Go!
[08:40.840 --> 08:41.840]  Go!
[08:41.840 --> 08:42.840]  Go!
[08:42.840 --> 08:43.840]  Go!
[08:43.840 --> 08:44.840]  Go!
[08:44.840 --> 08:45.840]  Go!
[08:45.840 --> 08:46.840]  Go!
[08:46.840 --> 08:47.840]  Go!
[08:47.840 --> 08:48.840]  Go!
[08:48.840 --> 08:49.840]  Go!
[08:49.840 --> 08:50.840]  Go!
[08:50.840 --> 08:51.840]  Go!
[08:51.840 --> 08:52.840]  Go!
[08:52.840 --> 08:53.840]  Let's go, Mom!
[08:53.840 --> 08:54.840]  It's late.
[08:54.840 --> 08:55.840]  Your sister hasn't come back.
[08:55.840 --> 08:57.840]  I told her to come back before 11.
[08:57.840 --> 08:58.840]  We can't wait.
[08:58.840 --> 09:00.840]  I have to get there in time.
[09:00.840 --> 09:02.840]  I'll give her a few more minutes.
[09:02.840 --> 09:03.840]  Mom, it's an important match.
[09:03.840 --> 09:04.840]  I promised to stay there.
[09:04.840 --> 09:05.840]  Let's go.
[09:05.840 --> 09:06.840]  And you'll be successful.
[09:06.840 --> 09:07.840]  I'll try, Mom.
[09:07.840 --> 09:09.840]  But you have so many rules.
[09:09.840 --> 09:10.840]  You are my life.
[09:10.840 --> 09:12.840]  I only have rules to avoid problems.
[09:12.840 --> 09:14.840]  Nothing will happen to you.
[09:14.840 --> 09:15.840]  I don't think so, Mom.
[09:15.840 --> 09:16.840]  Let's go.
[09:16.840 --> 09:17.840]  Okay, Alfredo.
[09:17.840 --> 09:19.840]  Leave a note and tell her we'll be in the park.
[09:19.840 --> 09:21.840]  I'll bring my keys.
[09:26.840 --> 09:27.840]  Please, Mom.
[09:27.840 --> 09:28.840]  We have to go.
[09:28.840 --> 09:30.840]  I'm moving as fast as I can, son.
[09:30.840 --> 09:32.840]  I'll be there in time.
[09:32.840 --> 09:34.840]  Don't rush me, please.
[09:36.840 --> 09:37.840]  Good.
[09:58.840 --> 09:59.840]  Alfredo!
[09:59.840 --> 10:01.840]  Have you forgotten something?
[10:01.840 --> 10:02.840]  Thank you.
[10:07.840 --> 10:09.840]  THE END
[10:11.840 --> 10:13.840]  It was time you arrived.
[10:13.840 --> 10:14.840]  Are you late?
[10:14.840 --> 10:17.840]  Not yet, but they're about to start practicing.
[10:17.840 --> 10:19.840]  It was my sister's fault. She didn't come home.
[10:19.840 --> 10:20.840]  Let's go!
[10:37.840 --> 10:38.840]  Thank you.
[10:39.840 --> 10:40.840]  Yes!
[10:40.840 --> 10:41.840]  Bravo!
[10:45.840 --> 10:47.840]  Well done!
[10:48.840 --> 10:49.840]  Alfredo, thank you.
[10:49.840 --> 10:50.840]  That's it!
[10:50.840 --> 10:52.840]  Very good, Alfredo.
[10:52.840 --> 10:53.840]  That's how you do it.
[10:59.840 --> 11:01.840]  I remember, guys. Come here.
[11:01.840 --> 11:03.840]  Your positions are on the list.
[11:03.840 --> 11:05.840]  Check them out and get ready to take them
[11:05.840 --> 11:07.840]  as soon as the other team leaves, okay?
[11:13.840 --> 11:14.840]  Are you at the bank?
[11:14.840 --> 11:15.840]  You too.
[11:15.840 --> 11:17.840]  I'm always there.
[11:17.840 --> 11:19.840]  Hey, where are you going now?
[11:19.840 --> 11:21.840]  Let's see what's going on.
[11:23.840 --> 11:24.840]  Sir.
[11:24.840 --> 11:25.840]  Yes?
[11:25.840 --> 11:26.840]  I'm not playing today.
[11:26.840 --> 11:28.840]  Well, today you'll play as an entry.
[11:28.840 --> 11:29.840]  Why?
[11:29.840 --> 11:30.840]  You know the rules.
[11:30.840 --> 11:32.840]  If you don't practice, you don't play.
[11:32.840 --> 11:33.840]  You can't do it.
[11:33.840 --> 11:34.840]  Oh, no!
[11:34.840 --> 11:36.840]  They're the rules.
[11:36.840 --> 11:39.840]  You'll only play as an entry in the right garden.
[11:39.840 --> 11:40.840]  Understood?
[11:40.840 --> 11:41.840]  But I'm a very good player.
[11:41.840 --> 11:42.840]  This game is important.
[11:42.840 --> 11:43.840]  It's true.
[11:43.840 --> 11:44.840]  I need you to play.
[11:44.840 --> 11:46.840]  But there are many guys who have come
[11:46.840 --> 11:47.840]  every day in time.
[11:47.840 --> 11:49.840]  And they get really angry.
[11:49.840 --> 11:51.840]  It wouldn't be fair for them not to let them play.
[11:51.840 --> 11:52.840]  But they want you to play.
[11:52.840 --> 11:53.840]  And if we lose?
[11:53.840 --> 11:55.840]  If we lose, we lose.
[11:55.840 --> 11:57.840]  When one does wrong things,
[11:57.840 --> 11:58.840]  it hurts everyone.
[11:58.840 --> 11:59.840]  It's not fair.
[11:59.840 --> 12:00.840]  Well, I'll tell you something.
[12:00.840 --> 12:02.840]  It'll be better if you get used to it, Alfredo,
[12:02.840 --> 12:03.840]  because you'll have to respect
[12:03.840 --> 12:05.840]  all your life rules.
[12:05.840 --> 12:07.840]  Now let's go to the attack.
[12:07.840 --> 12:08.840]  Go sit down.
[12:08.840 --> 12:09.840]  Okay.
[12:09.840 --> 12:11.840]  Cheer your team up from the bench.
[12:11.840 --> 12:12.840]  Let's go.
[12:13.840 --> 12:15.840]  Are you going to play?
[12:15.840 --> 12:16.840]  Just one entry.
[12:16.840 --> 12:17.840]  We'll lose.
[12:17.840 --> 12:18.840]  I'm sorry.
[12:18.840 --> 12:19.840]  I broke the rules.
[12:19.840 --> 12:20.840]  That's terrible.
[12:20.840 --> 12:21.840]  They won't lose.
[12:21.840 --> 12:23.840]  I'm looking for Mrs. Silvia Martinez.
[12:23.840 --> 12:24.840]  Silvia Martinez?
[12:24.840 --> 12:26.840]  Yes, I'm Silvia Martinez.
[12:26.840 --> 12:28.840]  I'm sorry to alarm her.
[12:28.840 --> 12:29.840]  Can you come with me?
[12:29.840 --> 12:30.840]  What happened?
[12:30.840 --> 12:31.840]  It's her daughter.
[12:31.840 --> 12:32.840]  Teresa, what did she do?
[12:32.840 --> 12:33.840]  Where is she?
[12:36.840 --> 12:37.840]  Mom, I'm sorry.
[12:37.840 --> 12:39.840]  Teresa, what happened?
[12:39.840 --> 12:40.840]  Eduard.
[12:40.840 --> 12:42.840]  Eduard, what were you doing with Eduard?
[12:42.840 --> 12:43.840]  Listen to me, Mom.
[12:43.840 --> 12:44.840]  They hurt him.
[12:44.840 --> 12:46.840]  The man who was with her daughter sold drugs.
[12:46.840 --> 12:47.840]  Drugs?
[12:47.840 --> 12:48.840]  Is Eduard dead?
[12:48.840 --> 12:50.840]  No, but his car was destroyed.
[12:50.840 --> 12:52.840]  He has a drug problem.
[12:52.840 --> 12:54.840]  I didn't know anything about drugs, Mom.
[12:54.840 --> 12:55.840]  I swear.
[12:55.840 --> 12:57.840]  We believe your daughter is telling the truth, Mrs. Martinez.
[12:57.840 --> 13:00.840]  We've been watching that young man for a long time.
[13:02.840 --> 13:03.840]  You'll work for me.
[13:03.840 --> 13:04.840]  Can you start tomorrow?
[13:04.840 --> 13:05.840]  Of course.
[13:05.840 --> 13:07.840]  After my game.
[13:07.840 --> 13:08.840]  Okay, everything is fixed.
[13:08.840 --> 13:09.840]  Eduard gave me a job.
[13:09.840 --> 13:10.840]  Doing what?
[13:10.840 --> 13:11.840]  Sending packages.
[13:11.840 --> 13:13.840]  What kind of packages?
[13:13.840 --> 13:14.840]  I don't know.
[13:14.840 --> 13:15.840]  He didn't tell me.
[13:15.840 --> 13:16.840]  But they want me to play.
[13:16.840 --> 13:17.840]  What if we lose?
[13:17.840 --> 13:18.840]  What if we lose?
[13:18.840 --> 13:19.840]  We lose.
[13:19.840 --> 13:20.840]  When you do bad things,
[13:20.840 --> 13:21.840]  you hurt others.
[13:21.840 --> 13:23.840]  I don't understand why you don't listen to me.
[13:23.840 --> 13:24.840]  I try.
[13:24.840 --> 13:26.840]  But you have so many rules.
[13:26.840 --> 13:28.840]  You are my life.
[13:28.840 --> 13:30.840]  I have rules to avoid problems.
[13:30.840 --> 13:32.840]  Why do you worry so much about me?
[13:32.840 --> 13:33.840]  You are my friend.
[13:33.840 --> 13:35.840]  And I don't want you to get into trouble.
[13:35.840 --> 13:37.840]  Alfredo.
[13:38.840 --> 13:39.840]  Alfredo.
[13:39.840 --> 13:40.840]  Alfredo.
[13:40.840 --> 13:41.840]  Yes, Mom.
[13:41.840 --> 13:43.840]  Stay with Sonia until we come back, okay?
[13:44.840 --> 13:45.840]  Okay.
[13:45.840 --> 13:47.840]  No matter what happens, Mom.
[13:47.840 --> 13:49.840]  Yes, it's true.
[13:54.840 --> 13:56.840]  Only for me.
[14:24.840 --> 14:26.840]  To be continued...
