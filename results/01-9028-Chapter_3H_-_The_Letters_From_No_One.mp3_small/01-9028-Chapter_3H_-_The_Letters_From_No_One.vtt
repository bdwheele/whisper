00:00.000 --> 00:03.760
Wouldn't it be better just to go home, dear?"

00:03.760 --> 00:09.120
Armpitunia suggested timidly hours later. But Uncle Vernon didn't seem to hear her.

00:09.120 --> 00:14.360
Exactly what he was looking for none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest,

00:14.360 --> 00:19.600
got out, looked around, shook his head, got back into the car, and off they went again.

00:19.600 --> 00:23.280
The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension

00:23.280 --> 00:27.160
bridge, and at the top of a multi-level parking garage.

00:27.920 --> 00:34.280
Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he? Dudley asked Armpitunia, Dully, later that afternoon.

00:34.280 --> 00:40.080
Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.

00:40.080 --> 00:45.000
It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley sniveled.

00:45.000 --> 00:52.480
It's Monday, he told his mother. The great Humberto's on to-night. I want to stay somewhere

00:52.480 --> 00:54.880
with the television.

00:55.880 --> 01:01.440
This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday, and you could usually count on Dudley

01:01.440 --> 01:07.360
to know the days of the week because of television, then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry's eleventh

01:07.360 --> 01:13.360
birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun. Last year the Dursleys had given

01:13.360 --> 01:18.200
him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks. Still, you weren't eleven every

01:18.200 --> 01:24.560
day. Uncle Vernon was back, and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package,

01:24.560 --> 01:27.640
and didn't answer Armpitunia when she asked what he'd bought.

01:27.640 --> 01:33.920
Found the perfect place, he said. Come on, everyone out!

01:33.920 --> 01:38.960
It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock

01:38.960 --> 01:43.680
way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could

01:43.680 --> 01:48.120
imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there.

01:48.880 --> 01:54.680
Storm forecast for tonight, said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together, and

01:54.680 --> 02:00.760
this gentleman's kindly agreed to lend us his boat. A toothless old man came ambling

02:00.760 --> 02:05.840
up to them, pointing with a rather wicked grin at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-grey

02:05.840 --> 02:07.400
water below them.

02:07.400 --> 02:13.360
I've already got us some rations, said Uncle Vernon, so all aboard!

02:13.360 --> 02:18.440
It was freezing in the boat. ICC spray and rain crept down their necks, and a chilly

02:18.440 --> 02:23.520
wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours, they reached the rock, where Uncle

02:23.520 --> 02:30.400
Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken down house. The inside was horrible.

02:30.400 --> 02:35.600
It smelled strongly of seaweed. The wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and

02:35.600 --> 02:41.000
the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms.

02:41.000 --> 02:46.960
Uncle Vernon's rations turned out to be a bag of chips each, and four bananas. He tried

02:46.960 --> 02:51.240
to start a fire, but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.

02:51.240 --> 02:57.200
Could do with some of those letters now, eh? He said cheerfully.

02:57.200 --> 03:02.280
He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here

03:02.280 --> 03:07.760
in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn't cheer him

03:07.760 --> 03:08.480
up at all.
