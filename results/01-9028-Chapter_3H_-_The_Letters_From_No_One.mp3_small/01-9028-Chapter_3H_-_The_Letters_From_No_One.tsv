0	3760	Wouldn't it be better just to go home, dear?"
3760	9120	Armpitunia suggested timidly hours later. But Uncle Vernon didn't seem to hear her.
9120	14360	Exactly what he was looking for none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest,
14360	19600	got out, looked around, shook his head, got back into the car, and off they went again.
19600	23280	The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension
23280	27160	bridge, and at the top of a multi-level parking garage.
27920	34280	Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he? Dudley asked Armpitunia, Dully, later that afternoon.
34280	40080	Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.
40080	45000	It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley sniveled.
45000	52480	It's Monday, he told his mother. The great Humberto's on to-night. I want to stay somewhere
52480	54880	with the television.
55880	61440	This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday, and you could usually count on Dudley
61440	67360	to know the days of the week because of television, then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry's eleventh
67360	73360	birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun. Last year the Dursleys had given
73360	78200	him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks. Still, you weren't eleven every
78200	84560	day. Uncle Vernon was back, and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package,
84560	87640	and didn't answer Armpitunia when she asked what he'd bought.
87640	93920	Found the perfect place, he said. Come on, everyone out!
93920	98960	It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock
98960	103680	way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could
103680	108120	imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there.
108880	114680	Storm forecast for tonight, said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together, and
114680	120760	this gentleman's kindly agreed to lend us his boat. A toothless old man came ambling
120760	125840	up to them, pointing with a rather wicked grin at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-grey
125840	127400	water below them.
127400	133360	I've already got us some rations, said Uncle Vernon, so all aboard!
133360	138440	It was freezing in the boat. ICC spray and rain crept down their necks, and a chilly
138440	143520	wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours, they reached the rock, where Uncle
143520	150400	Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken down house. The inside was horrible.
150400	155600	It smelled strongly of seaweed. The wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and
155600	161000	the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms.
161000	166960	Uncle Vernon's rations turned out to be a bag of chips each, and four bananas. He tried
166960	171240	to start a fire, but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.
171240	177200	Could do with some of those letters now, eh? He said cheerfully.
177200	182280	He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here
182280	187760	in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn't cheer him
187760	188480	up at all.
