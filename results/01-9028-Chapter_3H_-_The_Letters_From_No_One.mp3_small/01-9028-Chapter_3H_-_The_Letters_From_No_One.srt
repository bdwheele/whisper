1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
Wouldn't it be better just to go home, dear?"

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:09,120
Armpitunia suggested timidly hours later. But Uncle Vernon didn't seem to hear her.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,360
Exactly what he was looking for none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest,

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,600
got out, looked around, shook his head, got back into the car, and off they went again.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,280
The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,160
bridge, and at the top of a multi-level parking garage.

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:34,280
Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he? Dudley asked Armpitunia, Dully, later that afternoon.

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:40,080
Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,000
It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley sniveled.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,480
It's Monday, he told his mother. The great Humberto's on to-night. I want to stay somewhere

11
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,880
with the television.

12
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:01,440
This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday, and you could usually count on Dudley

13
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,360
to know the days of the week because of television, then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry's eleventh

14
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,360
birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun. Last year the Dursleys had given

15
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,200
him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks. Still, you weren't eleven every

16
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:24,560
day. Uncle Vernon was back, and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package,

17
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,640
and didn't answer Armpitunia when she asked what he'd bought.

18
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:33,920
Found the perfect place, he said. Come on, everyone out!

19
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,960
It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock

20
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,680
way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could

21
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,120
imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there.

22
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,680
Storm forecast for tonight, said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together, and

23
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:00,760
this gentleman's kindly agreed to lend us his boat. A toothless old man came ambling

24
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:05,840
up to them, pointing with a rather wicked grin at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-grey

25
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,400
water below them.

26
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:13,360
I've already got us some rations, said Uncle Vernon, so all aboard!

27
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,440
It was freezing in the boat. ICC spray and rain crept down their necks, and a chilly

28
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:23,520
wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours, they reached the rock, where Uncle

29
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:30,400
Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken down house. The inside was horrible.

30
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,600
It smelled strongly of seaweed. The wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and

31
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:41,000
the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms.

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,960
Uncle Vernon's rations turned out to be a bag of chips each, and four bananas. He tried

33
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,240
to start a fire, but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.

34
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:57,200
Could do with some of those letters now, eh? He said cheerfully.

35
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,280
He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here

36
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,760
in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn't cheer him

37
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,480
up at all.
