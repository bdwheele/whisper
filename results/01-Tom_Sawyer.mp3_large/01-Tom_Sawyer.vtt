00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
A modern day warrior, mean, mean stride Today's Tom Sawyer, mean, mean pride

00:11.000 --> 00:28.000
Though his mind is not for rent, don't put him down as arrogant

00:28.000 --> 00:34.000
He's reserved a quiet defense, riding out the day's events

00:34.000 --> 00:57.000
What do you say about his company? Is what do you say about society?

00:57.000 --> 01:10.000
Catch the mist, catch the myth, catch the mystery, catch the myth

01:10.000 --> 01:27.000
The world is, the world is, love and life are deep, maybe as its skies are wide

01:27.000 --> 01:33.000
Today's Tom Sawyer, he gets high on you And the space he invades, he gets by on you

01:57.000 --> 02:12.000
He's reserved a quiet defense, riding out the day's events

02:12.000 --> 02:27.000
The world is, the world is, love and life are deep, maybe as its skies are wide

02:27.000 --> 02:48.000
Though his mind is not for rent, to any god or government

02:48.000 --> 03:12.000
Always hope for your discontent, those changes aren't permanent, but shaking

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
And what do you say about his company? Is what do you say about society?

03:18.000 --> 03:31.000
Catch the witness, catch the wit, catch the spirit, catch the spit

03:31.000 --> 03:48.000
The world is, the world is, love and life are deep, maybe as its eyes are wide

03:48.000 --> 03:57.000
Exit the warrior, today's Tom Sawyer, he gets high on you And the energy you trade, he gets right on to the friction of the day

04:18.000 --> 04:33.000
Thanks for watching!
