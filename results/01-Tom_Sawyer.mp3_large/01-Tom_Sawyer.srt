1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
A modern day warrior, mean, mean stride Today's Tom Sawyer, mean, mean pride

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Though his mind is not for rent, don't put him down as arrogant

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
He's reserved a quiet defense, riding out the day's events

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What do you say about his company? Is what do you say about society?

5
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Catch the mist, catch the myth, catch the mystery, catch the myth

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The world is, the world is, love and life are deep, maybe as its skies are wide

7
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Today's Tom Sawyer, he gets high on you And the space he invades, he gets by on you

8
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:12,000
He's reserved a quiet defense, riding out the day's events

9
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The world is, the world is, love and life are deep, maybe as its skies are wide

10
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Though his mind is not for rent, to any god or government

11
00:02:48,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Always hope for your discontent, those changes aren't permanent, but shaking

12
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And what do you say about his company? Is what do you say about society?

13
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Catch the witness, catch the wit, catch the spirit, catch the spit

14
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The world is, the world is, love and life are deep, maybe as its eyes are wide

15
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Exit the warrior, today's Tom Sawyer, he gets high on you And the energy you trade, he gets right on to the friction of the day

16
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Thanks for watching!
