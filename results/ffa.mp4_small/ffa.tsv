120000	149880	Ladies and gentlemen members of the FFA I'd like to take just a minute to talk
149880	155400	to you about heart and I know I don't have to tell FFA members about heart
155400	162200	but I would like to turn it over to the heart of the band our lead tuba player
162200	165200	Ron Ruff
168280	173960	I'm Ron Ruff and I represent the Montana Association. I'm Brad Sared and I'm
173960	179920	representing the Mississippi Association. I'd like to congratulate Nancy Mason and
179920	184280	the other FFA officers, I mean members that got elected as national officers. At
184280	189040	this time let's give them a warm round of applause for their accomplishments.
189040	206720	With the tuba sections please stand up. Would Mr. Inglith and Mr. Heed please report to the stage.
212840	217400	As you all know we've been working very hard this last week. We got here last
217400	221120	Sunday our first rehearsal is one o'clock in the afternoon and I must admit it
221120	227480	didn't sound like too much at first but through the work of Mr. Heath and Mr.
227480	233120	Inglith we got a very good sounding band put together. I'm very proud to be a part
233120	241440	of this band. The tuba section and I decided we would show Mr. Heath our
241480	254480	appreciation. We all chipped in and got him this t-shirt here. On the front it
254480	261360	says FFA National Band Tubas, Kansas City, Missouri 1984. On the back it says
261360	267200	honorary director for life. Mr. Heath we'd like you to have this. Wear it in
267200	277040	good health. Thank you. Now Mr. Inglith he has been assisting Mr. Heath all
277040	283000	throughout the week and he has proven his capabilities. One day Mr. Heath had
283000	291080	to go to Denver on urgent business and Mr. E took over. So we got Mr. E a t-shirt
291080	299280	also. Same thing on the front. Simply Mr. E on the back. Thank you. We appreciate
299280	302240	it very much Mr. E.
309600	314840	Would Mrs. Heath and Mrs. E please come to the stage?
314840	328480	Would Mr. E and Mr. Heath please come to the stage also? On behalf of the band we'd
328480	332800	like to give them just a small token. It's only a little bit to express how much
332800	338680	they do for us but their willingness and dedication to help us has made us the
338680	343740	band that we are for you today. Thank you Mr. Heath, Mrs. Heath and Mr. and Mrs.
343740	346060	Inglith.
360140	364020	Hello future farmers I'm Joe Campbell from the Wyoming Association. I have a
364020	367780	special friend here who's gonna help me introduce the national band. His name is
367780	374580	Kermit the Frog. Hi I'm Kermit the Frog. Okay I just want to say I am also a
374580	381820	former FFA member. You are? Yeah. Future Frogies of America.
386860	393620	Okay the next song you're gonna hear is a popular song it's on a movie
393620	399260	starring Mr. E. and it's called The Thing from the A-Team and here is the
399260	403380	national FFA band.
453620	456380	The Thing from the A-Team.
484020	491340	We'd like to welcome you to the musical extravaganza tonight and what we have
491340	494700	put together is the best of the acts that you've seen throughout the
494700	499060	convention. The national band, the chorus and the talent acts. Right now I'd like
499060	503180	to introduce to you a young lady who is going to introduce the next chorus
503180	507820	number. We hope you enjoy this musical spectacular this evening. Holly would you
507860	513580	like to tell us about the chorus? We could think of no better way to start off
513580	517460	this evening than by bringing out a little bit of that enthusiasm that I
517460	531540	know is in all of you tonight. So we're gonna rise up singing.
538820	541820	Don't arise unscathed.
541820	543820	Rise unscathed.
543820	545820	It's a brand new day.

564820	570820	I woke up this morning and saw the rising of the sun.
570820	576820	All at once I realized that a brand new day had begun.
576820	582820	I glanced outside my window and jumped right out of my bed.
582820	587820	I looked around for my feet on the ground and this is what I said.
587820	589820	Rise unscathed.

613820	619820	You wake up some morning and the sky seems cloudy and gray.
619820	625820	Just remember what I said and things will work out okay.
625820	631820	Open up your windows and take a breath of fresh air.
631820	637820	Stand up proud to say it out loud for all the world to hear.
637820	639820	Rise unscathed.

724820	726820	Hello, I'm Sean Ross.
729820	735820	Hello, I'm Sean Ross and I'm from the Webberville FFA chapter, Webberville, Michigan.
735820	741820	I'm James Greenwald from the Lingaforte Laramie FFA chapter in Wyoming. Let's go, pokes!
742820	746820	I'm Matt Mills from the Mission Valley FFA chapter in Kansas.
748820	752820	I'm Ron Ruff. I'm Ron Ruff from the Belt Valley chapter, Belt, Montana.
753820	757820	I'm David Bridges from Florida. It's somewhat warmer there right now.
757820	760820	We're going to play a song called Dicks Land Jamboree.
765820	767820	Dicks Land Jamboree.
795820	797820	Dicks Land Jamboree.
825820	827820	Dicks Land Jamboree.

1035820	1050820	And next, we have from Breckenridge, Michigan, a young lady who's been tap dancing for about 11 years.
1050820	1053820	Her name is Tammy Valier and she has cleaned it up the town.
1053820	1058820	Would you have a big round of applause, please, for Tammy Valier. Bring her on.
1065820	1067820	Let's go.
1095820	1099820	The time won't back it, but the air won't disappear.
1099820	1101820	They knew that they were missing some more.
1101820	1104820	The boys and the teachers only called us Mother and Sheep.
1104820	1108820	They were the parts that taught them how to do the joys that they're fighting.
1108820	1111820	And now they're the parts that the both of us must be standing.
1111820	1114820	We're in love this time.
1114820	1116820	Oh, yeah.
1124820	1129820	The boys came up and they'd seen those books for real.
1129820	1131820	And they knew they'd get it right.
1131820	1134820	The words told them they had nothing to fear.
1134820	1136820	Yeah, the boys were real.
1136820	1139820	They were standing in the hearts, but made it still.
1139820	1144820	And they saw it back around and the whole town started to roar.
1144820	1147820	And she was standing like so strong.
1147820	1149820	She was falling down to the floor.
1149820	1152820	They were boxing and jumping and she was doing stuff right here.
1152820	1155820	And they got down to the point where it goes fast as she came.
1155820	1158820	They were standing on the top.
1158820	1162820	They were boxing and jumping and she was doing stuff right here.
1162820	1166820	And they got down to the point where you should see those spectators in the trance.
1166820	1169820	Look what's made you dance.
1196820	1208820	Well, I've been up to your door, happy now that I'm not a grown-up boy.
1208820	1211820	But if the boys had come to the rest of the cruise,
1211820	1213820	I'm gonna be making noise.
1213820	1217820	They were boxing and jumping and she was doing stuff right here.
1217820	1220820	And they got down to the point where it goes fast as she came.
1220820	1223820	We're cleaning up the town.

1246820	1249820	Nanny Valier.
1249820	1254820	Next we'd like you to meet a couple of the singers in the chorus.
1254820	1257820	The gentleman's name is Alan Broussard.
1257820	1260820	He has been with me for over a couple of years now from Louisiana,
1260820	1262820	and he's also the student director of the group
1262820	1264820	and been doing some introductions.
1264820	1267820	And the young lady is from Missouri.
1267820	1268820	Her name is Rachel McDonald,
1268820	1270820	and she's the sister of Becky McDonald,
1270820	1272820	who's been with me for about three years.
1272820	1274820	They're going to be doing an Anne Murray tune
1274820	1276820	and a duet entitled,
1276820	1279820	Nobody Loves Me Like You Do.
1279820	1282820	Let's go, Rachel and Alan.
1282820	1297820	["The Choir's Song"]
1297820	1304820	Like a candle burning bright
1304820	1310820	Love is glowing in your eyes
1310820	1313820	Flame turned light our way
1313820	1317820	That burns brighter every day
1317820	1325820	Now I have you
1325820	1337820	Nobody loves me like you do
1337820	1344820	Like a leaf upon the wind
1344820	1350820	I could find no place to hide
1350820	1354820	I dream the hours away
1354820	1358820	Wandered every day
1358820	1366820	Do dreams come true
1366820	1373820	Nobody loves me like you do
1373820	1377820	What if I never met you?
1377820	1380820	Where would I be right now?
1380820	1387820	Funny how life just falls in place somehow
1387820	1391820	You touch my heart in places
1391820	1395820	That I never even knew
1395820	1407820	Nobody loves me like you do
1407820	1414820	I was words without a tune
1414820	1420820	I was a song still unsung
1420820	1424820	A poem with no rhyme
1424820	1427820	A dancer out of time
1427820	1435820	But now there's you
1435820	1442820	Nobody loves me like you do
1442820	1446820	What if I never met you?
1446820	1449820	Where would I be right now?
1449820	1456820	Funny how life just falls in place somehow
1456820	1460820	You touch my heart in places
1460820	1464820	That I never even knew
1464820	1468820	Nobody loves me
1468820	1471820	Nobody loves me
1471820	1478820	Nobody loves me like you do
1478820	1494820	Nobody loves me like you do
1494820	1515820	The next song I'd like to introduce to you represents the entire reason why we are here this evening and throughout the week.
1515820	1518820	We would like to celebrate the music.
1524820	1530820	The song you say by melody
1530820	1536820	The song you say by words
1536820	1542820	When I hear, I hear my music
1542820	1548820	I want to sing, I want to sing with you
1548820	1554820	I want the world to sing my song with me
1554820	1560820	I want the world to hear my song
1560820	1566820	So come on, come on, let your hands with me
1566820	1572820	I got the song and you got the time
1572820	1578820	Celebrate the music, celebrate the good times
1578820	1583820	Let the music move you to the beat of the band
1583820	1587820	Sing it one more time
1587820	1593820	Celebrate the music, celebrate the good times
1593820	1599820	Let the music move you to the beat of the band
1602820	1608820	My song, never let the music stop
1608820	1612820	I want a good time
1612820	1614820	Never let the rhythm drop
1614820	1618820	I want to sing my song
1618820	1620820	Never let the music stop
1620820	1624820	Good song
1624820	1626820	Never let the rhythm drop
1626820	1630820	I want to sing my song
1630820	1632820	Never let the music stop
1632820	1636820	Good song
1636820	1639820	Celebrate the music
1639820	1642820	Celebrate the good times

1647820	1651820	Sing it one more time
1651820	1655820	Celebrate the music
1655820	1663820	with my song
1673820	1676820	Hi there
1676820	1680820	Having a good time?
1680820	1684820	I'm Susan Hahn and I'm from the Minnesota chapter
1689820	1695820	You've heard the band play contemporary music, Dixieland music, and patriotic music
1695820	1700820	And now the band is going to prove that it can also rock
1704820	1707820	We have two soloists, one is on the trap set
1707820	1709820	And that is Chris Pan Baker
1709820	1713820	And we have a twirler, which is Cheryl Van Luen
1857820	1867820	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
1867820	1875820	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
1888820	1894820	How many of you out there like Lionel Richie?
1901820	1905820	Well, I'm sorry to say that he was unable to be with us this evening
1905820	1908820	But he sent his brother instead
1908820	1914820	I'd like to introduce to you Charles Johnson from the Indiana Association
1914820	1917820	And he would just like to say hello
1944820	1949820	With you inside my mind
1949820	1956820	And in my dreams I kissed your lips a thousand times
1956820	1964820	And sometimes see you pass outside my door
1964820	1967820	Hello
1967820	1971820	Is it me you're looking for?
1971820	1975820	I can see it in your eyes
1975820	1979820	I can see it in your smile
1979820	1983820	You all I ever wanted
1983820	1986820	My arms open wide
1986820	1990820	Cause you know just what to say
1990820	1994820	And you know just what to do

2015820	2019820	And tell you time and time again
2019820	2022820	How much I care
2022820	2029820	Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow

2051820	2054820	Tell me how to win your heart
2054820	2059820	For I haven't got a clue

2285820	2287820	We're going to do a song right now
2287820	2290820	I'm going to dedicate this one
2290820	2293820	Narrow it down a little bit
2293820	2296820	Got any rodeoers out there
2296820	2298820	Any rodeoers?
2298820	2302820	And we'll include all people from Texas on this song
2313820	2321820	Everything that I got is just what I got on
2321820	2325820	When that sun is high in that Texas sky
2325820	2330820	I'll be looking at your county fair
2330820	2333820	Amorillo by morning
2333820	2337820	Amorillo I'll be there
2343820	2346820	They took my saddle in Houston
2346820	2350820	Broke my leg in Santa Fe
2350820	2354820	Lost my wife and a girlfriend
2354820	2359820	Somewhere along the way
2359820	2363820	And I'll be looking for aid when they pull that gate
2363820	2368820	And I hope that judge ain't blind
2368820	2371820	Amorillo by morning
2371820	2376820	Amorillo's on my mind
2381820	2385820	Amorillo by morning
2385820	2389820	Up from San Antonio
2389820	2392820	Everything that I got
2392820	2397820	Is just what I've got on
2397820	2399820	I ain't got a dime
2399820	2401820	But what I got is mine
2401820	2405820	I ain't rich but Lord I'm free
2405820	2408820	And Amorillo by morning
2408820	2413820	Amorillo's where I'll be
2413820	2416820	Amorillo by morning
2416820	2421820	Amorillo's where I'll be
2429820	2434820	Thank you
2434820	2435820	Thank you
2435820	2438820	And we're gonna close my part of the show out right fast
2438820	2442820	With a verse and a chorus or two of Foggy Mountain Breakdown
2442820	2444820	Had it back by popular request
2489820	2490820	Thank you
2516820	2517820	Thank you
2519820	2520820	Thank you
2529820	2532820	There's been a fresh contemporary arrangement made
2532820	2535820	Of tunes like Yankee Doodle, Chester and America the Beautiful
2535820	2539820	Which have been put together into a neat patriotic package
2539820	2542820	That we are going to perform for you right now
2542820	2545820	The American Trilogy by Jay Chattoway

3209820	3229820	Now I'd like a big round of applause please for the Danville, Alabama string band. Will you bring them on Danville, Alabama? Let's roll it. These guys are good and we're going to have a little kicking music here now. You got everything set up? Ladies and gentlemen, the Danville, Alabama band, go.
3240820	3262820	As I sit here, along with my memories, thinking back to the years long ago, to the past, to hear us down in Georgia, and the sweet girl that I used to know. She was young and in love with me only.
3262820	3273820	I was good news and foolish I guess, so I walked her right out of her sweet Georgia heart, and the fact that I'm lonely tells me friends.
3273820	3288820	How I miss my Georgia girl today, how I miss the pine woods and her hot Georgia clay, how I miss the simple life so many miles away, how I miss my Georgia girl today.
3292820	3303820	Music
3303820	3317820	There's a moon shining bright on my doorstep, like I seem shiny, bright and bright, but it's cool to learn my flasco, and I shoot the moon along with mine.
3317820	3332820	Fifteen years have slipped through my fingers, I've got this night known by the sky, but I won't lose you, my Georgia wings are cold, if I don't see anything this time.
3332820	3351820	How I miss my Georgia girl today, how I miss the pine woods and her hot Georgia clay, how I miss the simple life so many miles away, how I miss my Georgia girl today, how I miss my Georgia girl today.
3351820	3357820	Music
3357820	3377820	Well, these highway 40 blue, I won't tell them off my shoes, how many days since I've been gone, I've loved seeing the lights at home, wasted time with money too, so I need to search the truth.
3378820	3385820	In the kid I had to lose, lose a little bit of paper, cause I've got these highway 40 miles away.
3385820	3398820	I wake home when I was young, told me lies are things that come, leaving fortune lies ahead, that's what the moonlight has said.
3399820	3412820	Shedding dreams of mine is done, money is ghost, I got my gun, I don't feel with bitter tears, but ain't been holding you, I think I wake 40 miles away.
3415820	3441820	Music
3441820	3455820	You know I've rambled all around, I could roll myself in town to town, with pretty girls that have to say, none of them can make me stay.
3455820	3469820	I'm playing music all the time, and fancy clothes, big climb cars, think some country boy can't use, think some land is yours, you got these highway 40 miles away.
3470820	3478820	Music
3479820	3481820	Thank you very much.
3485820	3497820	There's a message for Arthur Slaughter's of the Caldwell County Chapter in Princeton, Kentucky, you're to report to the information booth in the lobby.
3497820	3510820	Hello everyone, I'm Shanna Murdoch from the Washington Association.
3511820	3518820	In our next number, the band will be featuring three very talented trumpet players.
3518820	3531820	Their names are Mark Obertas of Montana, Steve Szilacic from Wisconsin, and James Greenwald of Wyoming.
3532820	3543820	And I'd also like to add that James is a member of the McDonald's All American High School Band, which will be performing at Macy's at Thanksgiving time, and in the Rose Parade in California.
3543820	3550820	Now I'm very pleased to present you with Bugler's Holiday.

3748820	3760820	This next song has been very popular for quite some time, and the soloist we have to present to you tonight is probably one of the finest I've seen in a long time.
3761820	3769820	He's probably even better than the record itself. We hope that the chills we experience each time we say these words will be conveyed to you.
3769820	3777820	Now allow me to introduce Jason Frazier, a guy we all like to call Bird, representing the Texas Association.

4020820	4029820	Good evening, future farmers. My name is Maureen Freeman and I represent the state of Nebraska.
4029820	4044820	As we look at our American history, we find the pride, the patriotism, and the opportunities granted us, and the next song we're about to play resembles all of those things.
