WEBVTT

02:00.000 --> 02:29.880
Ladies and gentlemen members of the FFA I'd like to take just a minute to talk

02:29.880 --> 02:35.400
to you about heart and I know I don't have to tell FFA members about heart

02:35.400 --> 02:42.200
but I would like to turn it over to the heart of the band our lead tuba player

02:42.200 --> 02:45.200
Ron Ruff

02:48.280 --> 02:53.960
I'm Ron Ruff and I represent the Montana Association. I'm Brad Sared and I'm

02:53.960 --> 02:59.920
representing the Mississippi Association. I'd like to congratulate Nancy Mason and

02:59.920 --> 03:04.280
the other FFA officers, I mean members that got elected as national officers. At

03:04.280 --> 03:09.040
this time let's give them a warm round of applause for their accomplishments.

03:09.040 --> 03:26.720
With the tuba sections please stand up. Would Mr. Inglith and Mr. Heed please report to the stage.

03:32.840 --> 03:37.400
As you all know we've been working very hard this last week. We got here last

03:37.400 --> 03:41.120
Sunday our first rehearsal is one o'clock in the afternoon and I must admit it

03:41.120 --> 03:47.480
didn't sound like too much at first but through the work of Mr. Heath and Mr.

03:47.480 --> 03:53.120
Inglith we got a very good sounding band put together. I'm very proud to be a part

03:53.120 --> 04:01.440
of this band. The tuba section and I decided we would show Mr. Heath our

04:01.480 --> 04:14.480
appreciation. We all chipped in and got him this t-shirt here. On the front it

04:14.480 --> 04:21.360
says FFA National Band Tubas, Kansas City, Missouri 1984. On the back it says

04:21.360 --> 04:27.200
honorary director for life. Mr. Heath we'd like you to have this. Wear it in

04:27.200 --> 04:37.040
good health. Thank you. Now Mr. Inglith he has been assisting Mr. Heath all

04:37.040 --> 04:43.000
throughout the week and he has proven his capabilities. One day Mr. Heath had

04:43.000 --> 04:51.080
to go to Denver on urgent business and Mr. E took over. So we got Mr. E a t-shirt

04:51.080 --> 04:59.280
also. Same thing on the front. Simply Mr. E on the back. Thank you. We appreciate

04:59.280 --> 05:02.240
it very much Mr. E.

05:09.600 --> 05:14.840
Would Mrs. Heath and Mrs. E please come to the stage?

05:14.840 --> 05:28.480
Would Mr. E and Mr. Heath please come to the stage also? On behalf of the band we'd

05:28.480 --> 05:32.800
like to give them just a small token. It's only a little bit to express how much

05:32.800 --> 05:38.680
they do for us but their willingness and dedication to help us has made us the

05:38.680 --> 05:43.740
band that we are for you today. Thank you Mr. Heath, Mrs. Heath and Mr. and Mrs.

05:43.740 --> 05:46.060
Inglith.

06:00.140 --> 06:04.020
Hello future farmers I'm Joe Campbell from the Wyoming Association. I have a

06:04.020 --> 06:07.780
special friend here who's gonna help me introduce the national band. His name is

06:07.780 --> 06:14.580
Kermit the Frog. Hi I'm Kermit the Frog. Okay I just want to say I am also a

06:14.580 --> 06:21.820
former FFA member. You are? Yeah. Future Frogies of America.

06:26.860 --> 06:33.620
Okay the next song you're gonna hear is a popular song it's on a movie

06:33.620 --> 06:39.260
starring Mr. E. and it's called The Thing from the A-Team and here is the

06:39.260 --> 06:43.380
national FFA band.

07:33.620 --> 07:36.380
The Thing from the A-Team.

08:04.020 --> 08:11.340
We'd like to welcome you to the musical extravaganza tonight and what we have

08:11.340 --> 08:14.700
put together is the best of the acts that you've seen throughout the

08:14.700 --> 08:19.060
convention. The national band, the chorus and the talent acts. Right now I'd like

08:19.060 --> 08:23.180
to introduce to you a young lady who is going to introduce the next chorus

08:23.180 --> 08:27.820
number. We hope you enjoy this musical spectacular this evening. Holly would you

08:27.860 --> 08:33.580
like to tell us about the chorus? We could think of no better way to start off

08:33.580 --> 08:37.460
this evening than by bringing out a little bit of that enthusiasm that I

08:37.460 --> 08:51.540
know is in all of you tonight. So we're gonna rise up singing.

08:58.820 --> 09:01.820
Don't arise unscathed.

09:01.820 --> 09:03.820
Rise unscathed.

09:03.820 --> 09:05.820
It's a brand new day.

09:05.820 --> 09:11.820
See the sun is shining and the rain is falling like it was just yesterday.

09:11.820 --> 09:13.820
Feel like living.

09:13.820 --> 09:15.820
Yes I feel like living.

09:15.820 --> 09:17.820
Got a reason to stay.

09:17.820 --> 09:19.820
Don't arise unscathed.

09:19.820 --> 09:24.820
Throw my troubles away cause it's a brand new day.

09:24.820 --> 09:30.820
I woke up this morning and saw the rising of the sun.

09:30.820 --> 09:36.820
All at once I realized that a brand new day had begun.

09:36.820 --> 09:42.820
I glanced outside my window and jumped right out of my bed.

09:42.820 --> 09:47.820
I looked around for my feet on the ground and this is what I said.

09:47.820 --> 09:49.820
Rise unscathed.

09:49.820 --> 09:51.820
It's a brand new day.

09:51.820 --> 09:59.820
See the sun is shining and the rain is falling like it was just yesterday.

09:59.820 --> 10:01.820
Feel like living.

10:01.820 --> 10:03.820
Yes I feel like living.

10:03.820 --> 10:05.820
Got a reason to stay.

10:05.820 --> 10:07.820
Gonna rise unscathed.

10:07.820 --> 10:13.820
Throw my troubles away cause it's a brand new day.

10:13.820 --> 10:19.820
You wake up some morning and the sky seems cloudy and gray.

10:19.820 --> 10:25.820
Just remember what I said and things will work out okay.

10:25.820 --> 10:31.820
Open up your windows and take a breath of fresh air.

10:31.820 --> 10:37.820
Stand up proud to say it out loud for all the world to hear.

10:37.820 --> 10:39.820
Rise unscathed.

10:39.820 --> 10:41.820
It's a brand new day.

10:41.820 --> 10:49.820
See the sun is shining and the rain is falling like it was just yesterday.

10:49.820 --> 10:51.820
Feel like living.

10:51.820 --> 10:55.820
Got a reason to stay.

10:55.820 --> 10:57.820
Gonna rise unscathed.

10:57.820 --> 11:01.820
Throw my troubles away cause it's a brand new day.

Brand new day.

11:11.820 --> 11:13.820
It's a brand new day.

11:13.820 --> 11:15.820
Gonna rise unscathed.

11:15.820 --> 11:17.820
Brand new day.

11:17.820 --> 11:19.820
Brand new day.

11:19.820 --> 11:25.820
See the sun is shining and the rain is falling like it was just yesterday.

11:25.820 --> 11:27.820
Feel like living.

11:27.820 --> 11:31.820
Got a reason to stay.

11:31.820 --> 11:33.820
Gonna rise unscathed.

11:33.820 --> 11:37.820
Throw my troubles away cause it's a brand new day.

11:37.820 --> 11:39.820
Brand new day.

11:43.820 --> 11:45.820
It's a brand new day.

11:45.820 --> 11:47.820
Brand new day.

11:47.820 --> 11:49.820
Brand new day.

11:50.820 --> 11:52.820
Brand new day.

12:04.820 --> 12:06.820
Hello, I'm Sean Ross.

12:09.820 --> 12:15.820
Hello, I'm Sean Ross and I'm from the Webberville FFA chapter, Webberville, Michigan.

12:15.820 --> 12:21.820
I'm James Greenwald from the Lingaforte Laramie FFA chapter in Wyoming. Let's go, pokes!

12:22.820 --> 12:26.820
I'm Matt Mills from the Mission Valley FFA chapter in Kansas.

12:28.820 --> 12:32.820
I'm Ron Ruff. I'm Ron Ruff from the Belt Valley chapter, Belt, Montana.

12:33.820 --> 12:37.820
I'm David Bridges from Florida. It's somewhat warmer there right now.

12:37.820 --> 12:40.820
We're going to play a song called Dicks Land Jamboree.

12:45.820 --> 12:47.820
Dicks Land Jamboree.

13:15.820 --> 13:17.820
Dicks Land Jamboree.

13:45.820 --> 13:47.820
Dicks Land Jamboree.

14:15.820 --> 14:17.820
Dicks Land Jamboree.

14:45.820 --> 14:47.820
Dicks Land Jamboree.

15:15.820 --> 15:17.820
Dicks Land Jamboree.

15:45.820 --> 15:47.820
Dicks Land Jamboree.

16:15.820 --> 16:17.820
Dicks Land Jamboree.

16:45.820 --> 16:47.820
Dicks Land Jamboree.

17:15.820 --> 17:30.820
And next, we have from Breckenridge, Michigan, a young lady who's been tap dancing for about 11 years.

17:30.820 --> 17:33.820
Her name is Tammy Valier and she has cleaned it up the town.

17:33.820 --> 17:38.820
Would you have a big round of applause, please, for Tammy Valier. Bring her on.

17:45.820 --> 17:47.820
Let's go.

18:15.820 --> 18:19.820
The time won't back it, but the air won't disappear.

18:19.820 --> 18:21.820
They knew that they were missing some more.

18:21.820 --> 18:24.820
The boys and the teachers only called us Mother and Sheep.

18:24.820 --> 18:28.820
They were the parts that taught them how to do the joys that they're fighting.

18:28.820 --> 18:31.820
And now they're the parts that the both of us must be standing.

18:31.820 --> 18:34.820
We're in love this time.

18:34.820 --> 18:36.820
Oh, yeah.

18:44.820 --> 18:49.820
The boys came up and they'd seen those books for real.

18:49.820 --> 18:51.820
And they knew they'd get it right.

18:51.820 --> 18:54.820
The words told them they had nothing to fear.

18:54.820 --> 18:56.820
Yeah, the boys were real.

18:56.820 --> 18:59.820
They were standing in the hearts, but made it still.

18:59.820 --> 19:04.820
And they saw it back around and the whole town started to roar.

19:04.820 --> 19:07.820
And she was standing like so strong.

19:07.820 --> 19:09.820
She was falling down to the floor.

19:09.820 --> 19:12.820
They were boxing and jumping and she was doing stuff right here.

19:12.820 --> 19:15.820
And they got down to the point where it goes fast as she came.

19:15.820 --> 19:18.820
They were standing on the top.

19:18.820 --> 19:22.820
They were boxing and jumping and she was doing stuff right here.

19:22.820 --> 19:26.820
And they got down to the point where you should see those spectators in the trance.

19:26.820 --> 19:29.820
Look what's made you dance.

19:56.820 --> 20:08.820
Well, I've been up to your door, happy now that I'm not a grown-up boy.

20:08.820 --> 20:11.820
But if the boys had come to the rest of the cruise,

20:11.820 --> 20:13.820
I'm gonna be making noise.

20:13.820 --> 20:17.820
They were boxing and jumping and she was doing stuff right here.

20:17.820 --> 20:20.820
And they got down to the point where it goes fast as she came.

20:20.820 --> 20:23.820
We're cleaning up the town.

20:26.820 --> 20:36.820
["The Choir's Song"]

20:36.820 --> 20:46.820
["The Choir's Song"]

20:46.820 --> 20:49.820
Nanny Valier.

20:49.820 --> 20:54.820
Next we'd like you to meet a couple of the singers in the chorus.

20:54.820 --> 20:57.820
The gentleman's name is Alan Broussard.

20:57.820 --> 21:00.820
He has been with me for over a couple of years now from Louisiana,

21:00.820 --> 21:02.820
and he's also the student director of the group

21:02.820 --> 21:04.820
and been doing some introductions.

21:04.820 --> 21:07.820
And the young lady is from Missouri.

21:07.820 --> 21:08.820
Her name is Rachel McDonald,

21:08.820 --> 21:10.820
and she's the sister of Becky McDonald,

21:10.820 --> 21:12.820
who's been with me for about three years.

21:12.820 --> 21:14.820
They're going to be doing an Anne Murray tune

21:14.820 --> 21:16.820
and a duet entitled,

21:16.820 --> 21:19.820
Nobody Loves Me Like You Do.

21:19.820 --> 21:22.820
Let's go, Rachel and Alan.

21:22.820 --> 21:37.820
["The Choir's Song"]

21:37.820 --> 21:44.820
Like a candle burning bright

21:44.820 --> 21:50.820
Love is glowing in your eyes

21:50.820 --> 21:53.820
Flame turned light our way

21:53.820 --> 21:57.820
That burns brighter every day

21:57.820 --> 22:05.820
Now I have you

22:05.820 --> 22:17.820
Nobody loves me like you do

22:17.820 --> 22:24.820
Like a leaf upon the wind

22:24.820 --> 22:30.820
I could find no place to hide

22:30.820 --> 22:34.820
I dream the hours away

22:34.820 --> 22:38.820
Wandered every day

22:38.820 --> 22:46.820
Do dreams come true

22:46.820 --> 22:53.820
Nobody loves me like you do

22:53.820 --> 22:57.820
What if I never met you?

22:57.820 --> 23:00.820
Where would I be right now?

23:00.820 --> 23:07.820
Funny how life just falls in place somehow

23:07.820 --> 23:11.820
You touch my heart in places

23:11.820 --> 23:15.820
That I never even knew

23:15.820 --> 23:27.820
Nobody loves me like you do

23:27.820 --> 23:34.820
I was words without a tune

23:34.820 --> 23:40.820
I was a song still unsung

23:40.820 --> 23:44.820
A poem with no rhyme

23:44.820 --> 23:47.820
A dancer out of time

23:47.820 --> 23:55.820
But now there's you

23:55.820 --> 24:02.820
Nobody loves me like you do

24:02.820 --> 24:06.820
What if I never met you?

24:06.820 --> 24:09.820
Where would I be right now?

24:09.820 --> 24:16.820
Funny how life just falls in place somehow

24:16.820 --> 24:20.820
You touch my heart in places

24:20.820 --> 24:24.820
That I never even knew

24:24.820 --> 24:28.820
Nobody loves me

24:28.820 --> 24:31.820
Nobody loves me

24:31.820 --> 24:38.820
Nobody loves me like you do

24:38.820 --> 24:54.820
Nobody loves me like you do

24:54.820 --> 25:15.820
The next song I'd like to introduce to you represents the entire reason why we are here this evening and throughout the week.

25:15.820 --> 25:18.820
We would like to celebrate the music.

25:24.820 --> 25:30.820
The song you say by melody

25:30.820 --> 25:36.820
The song you say by words

25:36.820 --> 25:42.820
When I hear, I hear my music

25:42.820 --> 25:48.820
I want to sing, I want to sing with you

25:48.820 --> 25:54.820
I want the world to sing my song with me

25:54.820 --> 26:00.820
I want the world to hear my song

26:00.820 --> 26:06.820
So come on, come on, let your hands with me

26:06.820 --> 26:12.820
I got the song and you got the time

26:12.820 --> 26:18.820
Celebrate the music, celebrate the good times

26:18.820 --> 26:23.820
Let the music move you to the beat of the band

26:23.820 --> 26:27.820
Sing it one more time

26:27.820 --> 26:33.820
Celebrate the music, celebrate the good times

26:33.820 --> 26:39.820
Let the music move you to the beat of the band

26:42.820 --> 26:48.820
My song, never let the music stop

26:48.820 --> 26:52.820
I want a good time

26:52.820 --> 26:54.820
Never let the rhythm drop

26:54.820 --> 26:58.820
I want to sing my song

26:58.820 --> 27:00.820
Never let the music stop

27:00.820 --> 27:04.820
Good song

27:04.820 --> 27:06.820
Never let the rhythm drop

27:06.820 --> 27:10.820
I want to sing my song

27:10.820 --> 27:12.820
Never let the music stop

27:12.820 --> 27:16.820
Good song

27:16.820 --> 27:19.820
Celebrate the music

27:19.820 --> 27:22.820
Celebrate the good times

27:22.820 --> 27:27.820
Let the music move you to the beat of the band

27:27.820 --> 27:31.820
Sing it one more time

27:31.820 --> 27:35.820
Celebrate the music

27:35.820 --> 27:43.820
with my song

27:53.820 --> 27:56.820
Hi there

27:56.820 --> 28:00.820
Having a good time?

28:00.820 --> 28:04.820
I'm Susan Hahn and I'm from the Minnesota chapter

28:09.820 --> 28:15.820
You've heard the band play contemporary music, Dixieland music, and patriotic music

28:15.820 --> 28:20.820
And now the band is going to prove that it can also rock

28:24.820 --> 28:27.820
We have two soloists, one is on the trap set

28:27.820 --> 28:29.820
And that is Chris Pan Baker

28:29.820 --> 28:33.820
And we have a twirler, which is Cheryl Van Luen

30:57.820 --> 31:07.820
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

31:07.820 --> 31:15.820
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

31:28.820 --> 31:34.820
How many of you out there like Lionel Richie?

31:41.820 --> 31:45.820
Well, I'm sorry to say that he was unable to be with us this evening

31:45.820 --> 31:48.820
But he sent his brother instead

31:48.820 --> 31:54.820
I'd like to introduce to you Charles Johnson from the Indiana Association

31:54.820 --> 31:57.820
And he would just like to say hello

32:24.820 --> 32:29.820
With you inside my mind

32:29.820 --> 32:36.820
And in my dreams I kissed your lips a thousand times

32:36.820 --> 32:44.820
And sometimes see you pass outside my door

32:44.820 --> 32:47.820
Hello

32:47.820 --> 32:51.820
Is it me you're looking for?

32:51.820 --> 32:55.820
I can see it in your eyes

32:55.820 --> 32:59.820
I can see it in your smile

32:59.820 --> 33:03.820
You all I ever wanted

33:03.820 --> 33:06.820
My arms open wide

33:06.820 --> 33:10.820
Cause you know just what to say

33:10.820 --> 33:14.820
And you know just what to do

33:14.820 --> 33:19.820
And I want to tell you so much

33:19.820 --> 33:23.820
I love you

33:27.820 --> 33:35.820
I long to see the sunlight in your head

33:35.820 --> 33:39.820
And tell you time and time again

33:39.820 --> 33:42.820
How much I care

33:42.820 --> 33:49.820
Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow

33:49.820 --> 33:52.820
Hello

33:52.820 --> 33:56.820
I just got to let you know

33:56.820 --> 34:00.820
Cause I wonder where you are

34:00.820 --> 34:03.820
And I wonder what you do

34:03.820 --> 34:07.820
Are you somewhere feeling lonely

34:07.820 --> 34:11.820
Or someone loving you

34:11.820 --> 34:14.820
Tell me how to win your heart

34:14.820 --> 34:19.820
For I haven't got a clue

34:19.820 --> 34:24.820
But let me start by saying

34:24.820 --> 34:29.820
I love you

34:31.820 --> 34:34.820
Hello

34:34.820 --> 34:38.820
Is it me you're looking for?

34:38.820 --> 34:42.820
I can see it in your eyes

34:42.820 --> 34:46.820
I can see it in your eyes

34:46.820 --> 34:49.820
I just got to let you know

34:49.820 --> 34:52.820
Cause I wonder where you are

34:52.820 --> 34:56.820
And I wonder what you do

34:56.820 --> 35:00.820
Are you somewhere feeling lonely

35:00.820 --> 35:03.820
Or someone loving you

35:03.820 --> 35:07.820
Tell me how to win your heart

I love you

35:19.820 --> 35:22.820
Hello

35:23.820 --> 35:27.820
I love you

35:32.820 --> 35:36.820
Charles Johnson

35:37.820 --> 35:39.820
Wonderful

35:42.820 --> 35:46.820
There is an emergency message for Mr. Stengel from Dupre, Wisconsin

35:46.820 --> 35:49.820
Would you please report to the secretary station

35:49.820 --> 35:52.820
Mr. Stengel from Dupre, Wisconsin

35:52.820 --> 35:56.820
We'd next like to introduce you an act that really is one of the finest in the country

35:56.820 --> 36:00.820
Jimmy Milton has appeared on Grand Ole Opry

36:00.820 --> 36:05.820
He is the entertainer of the year in the Louisiana Hayride

36:05.820 --> 36:07.820
He's from Chester City, Tennessee

36:07.820 --> 36:09.820
Jimmy Milton and his father

36:09.820 --> 36:12.820
Ladies and gentlemen, let's have a big round of applause for the Miltons

36:12.820 --> 36:14.820
Right there they are

37:35.820 --> 37:37.820

Thank you

38:03.820 --> 38:05.820
Thank you very much

38:05.820 --> 38:07.820
We're going to do a song right now

38:07.820 --> 38:10.820
I'm going to dedicate this one

38:10.820 --> 38:13.820
Narrow it down a little bit

38:13.820 --> 38:16.820
Got any rodeoers out there

38:16.820 --> 38:18.820
Any rodeoers?

38:18.820 --> 38:22.820
And we'll include all people from Texas on this song

38:33.820 --> 38:41.820
Everything that I got is just what I got on

38:41.820 --> 38:45.820
When that sun is high in that Texas sky

38:45.820 --> 38:50.820
I'll be looking at your county fair

38:50.820 --> 38:53.820
Amorillo by morning

38:53.820 --> 38:57.820
Amorillo I'll be there

39:03.820 --> 39:06.820
They took my saddle in Houston

39:06.820 --> 39:10.820
Broke my leg in Santa Fe

39:10.820 --> 39:14.820
Lost my wife and a girlfriend

39:14.820 --> 39:19.820
Somewhere along the way

39:19.820 --> 39:23.820
And I'll be looking for aid when they pull that gate

39:23.820 --> 39:28.820
And I hope that judge ain't blind

39:28.820 --> 39:31.820
Amorillo by morning

39:31.820 --> 39:36.820
Amorillo's on my mind

39:41.820 --> 39:45.820
Amorillo by morning

39:45.820 --> 39:49.820
Up from San Antonio

39:49.820 --> 39:52.820
Everything that I got

39:52.820 --> 39:57.820
Is just what I've got on

39:57.820 --> 39:59.820
I ain't got a dime

39:59.820 --> 40:01.820
But what I got is mine

40:01.820 --> 40:05.820
I ain't rich but Lord I'm free

40:05.820 --> 40:08.820
And Amorillo by morning

40:08.820 --> 40:13.820
Amorillo's where I'll be

40:13.820 --> 40:16.820
Amorillo by morning

40:16.820 --> 40:21.820

Thank you

41:59.820 --> 42:00.820

42:12.820 --> 42:15.820
Of tunes like Yankee Doodle, Chester and America the Beautiful

42:15.820 --> 42:19.820
Which have been put together into a neat patriotic package

42:19.820 --> 42:22.820

Now I'd like a big round of applause please for the Danville, Alabama string band. Will you bring them on Danville, Alabama? Let's roll it. These guys are good and we're going to have a little kicking music here now. You got everything set up? Ladies and gentlemen, the Danville, Alabama band, go.

54:00.820 --> 54:22.820
As I sit here, along with my memories, thinking back to the years long ago, to the past, to hear us down in Georgia, and the sweet girl that I used to know. She was young and in love with me only.

54:22.820 --> 54:33.820
I was good news and foolish I guess, so I walked her right out of her sweet Georgia heart, and the fact that I'm lonely tells me friends.

54:33.820 --> 54:48.820
How I miss my Georgia girl today, how I miss the pine woods and her hot Georgia clay, how I miss the simple life so many miles away, how I miss my Georgia girl today.

54:52.820 --> 55:03.820
Music

55:03.820 --> 55:17.820
There's a moon shining bright on my doorstep, like I seem shiny, bright and bright, but it's cool to learn my flasco, and I shoot the moon along with mine.

55:17.820 --> 55:32.820
Fifteen years have slipped through my fingers, I've got this night known by the sky, but I won't lose you, my Georgia wings are cold, if I don't see anything this time.

55:32.820 --> 55:51.820
How I miss my Georgia girl today, how I miss the pine woods and her hot Georgia clay, how I miss the simple life so many miles away, how I miss my Georgia girl today, how I miss my Georgia girl today.

55:51.820 --> 55:57.820
Music

55:57.820 --> 56:17.820
Well, these highway 40 blue, I won't tell them off my shoes, how many days since I've been gone, I've loved seeing the lights at home, wasted time with money too, so I need to search the truth.

56:18.820 --> 56:25.820
In the kid I had to lose, lose a little bit of paper, cause I've got these highway 40 miles away.

56:25.820 --> 56:38.820
I wake home when I was young, told me lies are things that come, leaving fortune lies ahead, that's what the moonlight has said.

56:39.820 --> 56:52.820
Shedding dreams of mine is done, money is ghost, I got my gun, I don't feel with bitter tears, but ain't been holding you, I think I wake 40 miles away.

56:55.820 --> 57:21.820
Music

57:21.820 --> 57:35.820
You know I've rambled all around, I could roll myself in town to town, with pretty girls that have to say, none of them can make me stay.

57:35.820 --> 57:49.820
I'm playing music all the time, and fancy clothes, big climb cars, think some country boy can't use, think some land is yours, you got these highway 40 miles away.

57:50.820 --> 57:58.820
Music

57:59.820 --> 58:01.820
Thank you very much.

58:05.820 --> 58:17.820
There's a message for Arthur Slaughter's of the Caldwell County Chapter in Princeton, Kentucky, you're to report to the information booth in the lobby.

58:17.820 --> 58:30.820
Hello everyone, I'm Shanna Murdoch from the Washington Association.

58:31.820 --> 58:38.820
In our next number, the band will be featuring three very talented trumpet players.

58:38.820 --> 58:51.820
Their names are Mark Obertas of Montana, Steve Szilacic from Wisconsin, and James Greenwald of Wyoming.

58:52.820 --> 59:03.820
And I'd also like to add that James is a member of the McDonald's All American High School Band, which will be performing at Macy's at Thanksgiving time, and in the Rose Parade in California.

59:03.820 --> 59:10.820

Before I introduce our next song, we have an announcement with Doug Stengel, please go to the information booth which is outside in the lobby.

01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:40.820
This next song has been very popular for quite some time, and the soloist we have to present to you tonight is probably one of the finest I've seen in a long time.

01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:49.820
He's probably even better than the record itself. We hope that the chills we experience each time we say these words will be conveyed to you.

01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:57.820
Now allow me to introduce Jason Frazier, a guy we all like to call Bird, representing the Texas Association.

Good evening, future farmers. My name is Maureen Freeman and I represent the state of Nebraska.

01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:24.820
As we look at our American history, we find the pride, the patriotism, and the opportunities granted us, and the next song we're about to play resembles all of those things.

01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:39.820
We're now proud to introduce to you the John Philip Seuss's famous Stars and Stripes Forever, featuring pickle players Julie Hines of Ohio, Lynette Hess of Wisconsin, and Kanita McCord of Florida.
