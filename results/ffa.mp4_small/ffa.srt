1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:29,880
Ladies and gentlemen members of the FFA I'd like to take just a minute to talk

2
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:35,400
to you about heart and I know I don't have to tell FFA members about heart

3
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:42,200
but I would like to turn it over to the heart of the band our lead tuba player

4
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,200
Ron Ruff

5
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,960
I'm Ron Ruff and I represent the Montana Association. I'm Brad Sared and I'm

6
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:59,920
representing the Mississippi Association. I'd like to congratulate Nancy Mason and

7
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,280
the other FFA officers, I mean members that got elected as national officers. At

8
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,040
this time let's give them a warm round of applause for their accomplishments.

9
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:26,720
With the tuba sections please stand up. Would Mr. Inglith and Mr. Heed please report to the stage.

10
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,400
As you all know we've been working very hard this last week. We got here last

11
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,120
Sunday our first rehearsal is one o'clock in the afternoon and I must admit it

12
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,480
didn't sound like too much at first but through the work of Mr. Heath and Mr.

13
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:53,120
Inglith we got a very good sounding band put together. I'm very proud to be a part

14
00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:01,440
of this band. The tuba section and I decided we would show Mr. Heath our

15
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:14,480
appreciation. We all chipped in and got him this t-shirt here. On the front it

16
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:21,360
says FFA National Band Tubas, Kansas City, Missouri 1984. On the back it says

17
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:27,200
honorary director for life. Mr. Heath we'd like you to have this. Wear it in

18
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:37,040
good health. Thank you. Now Mr. Inglith he has been assisting Mr. Heath all

19
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:43,000
throughout the week and he has proven his capabilities. One day Mr. Heath had

20
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:51,080
to go to Denver on urgent business and Mr. E took over. So we got Mr. E a t-shirt

21
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:59,280
also. Same thing on the front. Simply Mr. E on the back. Thank you. We appreciate

22
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,240
it very much Mr. E.

23
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,840
Would Mrs. Heath and Mrs. E please come to the stage?

24
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:28,480
Would Mr. E and Mr. Heath please come to the stage also? On behalf of the band we'd

25
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,800
like to give them just a small token. It's only a little bit to express how much

26
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,680
they do for us but their willingness and dedication to help us has made us the

27
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,740
band that we are for you today. Thank you Mr. Heath, Mrs. Heath and Mr. and Mrs.

28
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,060
Inglith.

29
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:04,020
Hello future farmers I'm Joe Campbell from the Wyoming Association. I have a

30
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,780
special friend here who's gonna help me introduce the national band. His name is

31
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:14,580
Kermit the Frog. Hi I'm Kermit the Frog. Okay I just want to say I am also a

32
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:21,820
former FFA member. You are? Yeah. Future Frogies of America.

33
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:33,620
Okay the next song you're gonna hear is a popular song it's on a movie

34
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:39,260
starring Mr. E. and it's called The Thing from the A-Team and here is the

35
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:43,380
national FFA band.

36
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,380
The Thing from the A-Team.

37
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:11,340
We'd like to welcome you to the musical extravaganza tonight and what we have

38
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,700
put together is the best of the acts that you've seen throughout the

39
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:19,060
convention. The national band, the chorus and the talent acts. Right now I'd like

40
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:23,180
to introduce to you a young lady who is going to introduce the next chorus

41
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:27,820
number. We hope you enjoy this musical spectacular this evening. Holly would you

42
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:33,580
like to tell us about the chorus? We could think of no better way to start off

43
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:37,460
this evening than by bringing out a little bit of that enthusiasm that I

44
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:51,540
know is in all of you tonight. So we're gonna rise up singing.

45
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,820
Don't arise unscathed.

46
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,820
Rise unscathed.

47
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,820
It's a brand new day.

48
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:11,820
See the sun is shining and the rain is falling like it was just yesterday.

49
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,820
Feel like living.

50
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,820
Yes I feel like living.

51
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,820
Got a reason to stay.

52
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,820
Don't arise unscathed.

53
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:24,820
Throw my troubles away cause it's a brand new day.

54
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:30,820
I woke up this morning and saw the rising of the sun.

55
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:36,820
All at once I realized that a brand new day had begun.

56
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:42,820
I glanced outside my window and jumped right out of my bed.

57
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:47,820
I looked around for my feet on the ground and this is what I said.

58
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,820
Rise unscathed.

59
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,820
It's a brand new day.

60
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:59,820
See the sun is shining and the rain is falling like it was just yesterday.

61
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,820
Feel like living.

62
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,820
Yes I feel like living.

63
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,820
Got a reason to stay.

Gonna rise unscathed.

65
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:13,820
Throw my troubles away cause it's a brand new day.

66
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:19,820
You wake up some morning and the sky seems cloudy and gray.

67
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:25,820
Just remember what I said and things will work out okay.

68
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:31,820
Open up your windows and take a breath of fresh air.

69
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:37,820
Stand up proud to say it out loud for all the world to hear.

70
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,820
Rise unscathed.

71
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,820
It's a brand new day.

72
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:49,820
See the sun is shining and the rain is falling like it was just yesterday.

73
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,820
Feel like living.

74
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,820
Got a reason to stay.

75
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,820
Gonna rise unscathed.

76
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:01,820
Throw my troubles away cause it's a brand new day.

77
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:05,820
Brand new day.

78
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,820
Brand new day.

79
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,820
Brand new day.

80
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,820
Brand new day.

81
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,820
It's a brand new day.

82
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,820
Gonna rise unscathed.

Brand new day.

85
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:25,820
See the sun is shining and the rain is falling like it was just yesterday.

86
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,820
Feel like living.

87
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,820
Got a reason to stay.

88
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,820
Gonna rise unscathed.

89
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:37,820
Throw my troubles away cause it's a brand new day.

90
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,820

Brand new day.

94
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,820
Brand new day.

95
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,820
Hello, I'm Sean Ross.

96
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:15,820
Hello, I'm Sean Ross and I'm from the Webberville FFA chapter, Webberville, Michigan.

97
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:21,820
I'm James Greenwald from the Lingaforte Laramie FFA chapter in Wyoming. Let's go, pokes!

98
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,820
I'm Matt Mills from the Mission Valley FFA chapter in Kansas.

99
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,820
I'm Ron Ruff. I'm Ron Ruff from the Belt Valley chapter, Belt, Montana.

100
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,820
I'm David Bridges from Florida. It's somewhat warmer there right now.

101
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,820
We're going to play a song called Dicks Land Jamboree.

102
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,820
Dicks Land Jamboree.

103
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,820
Dicks Land Jamboree.

104
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,820
Dicks Land Jamboree.

105
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,820
Dicks Land Jamboree.

106
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,820
Dicks Land Jamboree.

107
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,820
Dicks Land Jamboree.

108
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,820
Dicks Land Jamboree.

109
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,820
Dicks Land Jamboree.

110
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,820
Dicks Land Jamboree.

111
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:30,820
And next, we have from Breckenridge, Michigan, a young lady who's been tap dancing for about 11 years.

112
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,820
Her name is Tammy Valier and she has cleaned it up the town.

113
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:38,820
Would you have a big round of applause, please, for Tammy Valier. Bring her on.

114
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,820
Let's go.

115
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,820
The time won't back it, but the air won't disappear.

116
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,820
They knew that they were missing some more.

117
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,820
The boys and the teachers only called us Mother and Sheep.

118
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,820
They were the parts that taught them how to do the joys that they're fighting.

119
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,820
And now they're the parts that the both of us must be standing.

120
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,820
We're in love this time.

121
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,820
Oh, yeah.

122
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:49,820
The boys came up and they'd seen those books for real.

123
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,820
And they knew they'd get it right.

124
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,820
The words told them they had nothing to fear.

125
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,820
Yeah, the boys were real.

126
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,820
They were standing in the hearts, but made it still.

127
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:04,820
And they saw it back around and the whole town started to roar.

128
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,820
And she was standing like so strong.

129
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,820
She was falling down to the floor.

130
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,820
They were boxing and jumping and she was doing stuff right here.

131
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,820
And they got down to the point where it goes fast as she came.

132
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,820
They were standing on the top.

133
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,820
They were boxing and jumping and she was doing stuff right here.

134
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:26,820
And they got down to the point where you should see those spectators in the trance.

135
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,820
Look what's made you dance.

136
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:08,820
Well, I've been up to your door, happy now that I'm not a grown-up boy.

137
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,820
But if the boys had come to the rest of the cruise,

138
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,820
I'm gonna be making noise.

139
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:17,820
They were boxing and jumping and she was doing stuff right here.

140
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,820
And they got down to the point where it goes fast as she came.

141
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,820
We're cleaning up the town.

142
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:36,820
["The Choir's Song"]

143
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:46,820
["The Choir's Song"]

144
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,820
Nanny Valier.

145
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:54,820
Next we'd like you to meet a couple of the singers in the chorus.

146
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,820
The gentleman's name is Alan Broussard.

147
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,820
He has been with me for over a couple of years now from Louisiana,

148
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,820
and he's also the student director of the group

149
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,820
and been doing some introductions.

150
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,820
And the young lady is from Missouri.

151
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:08,820
Her name is Rachel McDonald,

152
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,820
and she's the sister of Becky McDonald,

153
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,820
who's been with me for about three years.

154
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,820
They're going to be doing an Anne Murray tune

155
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,820
and a duet entitled,

156
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,820
Nobody Loves Me Like You Do.

157
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,820
Let's go, Rachel and Alan.

158
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:37,820
["The Choir's Song"]

159
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:44,820
Like a candle burning bright

160
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:50,820
Love is glowing in your eyes

161
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,820
Flame turned light our way

162
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:57,820
That burns brighter every day

163
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:05,820
Now I have you

164
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:17,820
Nobody loves me like you do

165
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:24,820
Like a leaf upon the wind

166
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:30,820
I could find no place to hide

167
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:34,820
I dream the hours away

168
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:38,820
Wandered every day

169
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:46,820
Do dreams come true

170
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:53,820
Nobody loves me like you do

171
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:57,820
What if I never met you?

172
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,820
Where would I be right now?

173
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:07,820
Funny how life just falls in place somehow

174
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,820
You touch my heart in places

175
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:15,820
That I never even knew

176
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:27,820
Nobody loves me like you do

177
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:34,820
I was words without a tune

178
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:40,820
I was a song still unsung

179
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:44,820
A poem with no rhyme

180
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,820
A dancer out of time

181
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:55,820
But now there's you

182
00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:02,820
Nobody loves me like you do

183
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:06,820
What if I never met you?

184
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,820
Where would I be right now?

185
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:16,820
Funny how life just falls in place somehow

186
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:20,820
You touch my heart in places

187
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,820
That I never even knew

188
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:28,820
Nobody loves me

189
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,820
Nobody loves me

190
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:38,820
Nobody loves me like you do

191
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:54,820
Nobody loves me like you do

192
00:24:54,820 --> 00:25:15,820
The next song I'd like to introduce to you represents the entire reason why we are here this evening and throughout the week.

193
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,820
We would like to celebrate the music.

194
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:30,820
The song you say by melody

195
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:36,820
The song you say by words

196
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:42,820
When I hear, I hear my music

197
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:48,820
I want to sing, I want to sing with you

198
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:54,820
I want the world to sing my song with me

199
00:25:54,820 --> 00:26:00,820
I want the world to hear my song

200
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:06,820
So come on, come on, let your hands with me

201
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:12,820
I got the song and you got the time

202
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:18,820
Celebrate the music, celebrate the good times

203
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:23,820
Let the music move you to the beat of the band

204
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:27,820
Sing it one more time

205
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:33,820
Celebrate the music, celebrate the good times

206
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:39,820
Let the music move you to the beat of the band

207
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:48,820
My song, never let the music stop

208
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:52,820
I want a good time

209
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,820
Never let the rhythm drop

210
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:58,820
I want to sing my song

211
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,820
Never let the music stop

212
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:04,820
Good song

213
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,820
Never let the rhythm drop

214
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:10,820
I want to sing my song

215
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,820
Never let the music stop

216
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:16,820
Good song

217
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:19,820
Celebrate the music

218
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,820
Celebrate the good times

219
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:27,820
Let the music move you to the beat of the band

220
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:31,820
Sing it one more time

221
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:35,820
Celebrate the music

222
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:43,820
with my song

223
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,820
Hi there

224
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:00,820
Having a good time?

225
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:04,820
I'm Susan Hahn and I'm from the Minnesota chapter

226
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:15,820
You've heard the band play contemporary music, Dixieland music, and patriotic music

227
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:20,820
And now the band is going to prove that it can also rock

228
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:27,820
We have two soloists, one is on the trap set

229
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,820
And that is Chris Pan Baker

230
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:33,820
And we have a twirler, which is Cheryl Van Luen

231
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:07,820
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

232
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:15,820
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

233
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:34,820
How many of you out there like Lionel Richie?

234
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:45,820
Well, I'm sorry to say that he was unable to be with us this evening

235
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,820
But he sent his brother instead

236
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:54,820
I'd like to introduce to you Charles Johnson from the Indiana Association

237
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:57,820
And he would just like to say hello

238
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:29,820
With you inside my mind

239
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:36,820
And in my dreams I kissed your lips a thousand times

240
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:44,820
And sometimes see you pass outside my door

241
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,820
Hello

242
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:51,820
Is it me you're looking for?

243
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:55,820
I can see it in your eyes

244
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:59,820
I can see it in your smile

245
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:03,820
You all I ever wanted

246
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,820
My arms open wide

247
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:10,820
Cause you know just what to say

248
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:14,820
And you know just what to do

249
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:19,820
And I want to tell you so much

250
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:23,820
I love you

251
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:35,820
I long to see the sunlight in your head

252
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:39,820
And tell you time and time again

253
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:42,820
How much I care

254
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:49,820
Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow

255
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,820
Hello

256
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:56,820
I just got to let you know

257
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:00,820
Cause I wonder where you are

258
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:03,820
And I wonder what you do

259
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:07,820
Are you somewhere feeling lonely

260
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:11,820
Or someone loving you

261
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,820
Tell me how to win your heart

262
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:19,820
For I haven't got a clue

263
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:24,820
But let me start by saying

264
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:29,820
I love you

265
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,820
Hello

266
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:38,820
Is it me you're looking for?

267
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:42,820
I can see it in your eyes

268
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:46,820
I can see it in your eyes

269
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:49,820
I just got to let you know

270
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:52,820
Cause I wonder where you are

271
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:56,820
And I wonder what you do

272
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:00,820
Are you somewhere feeling lonely

273
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:03,820
Or someone loving you

274
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:07,820
Tell me how to win your heart

275
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:10,820
For I haven't got a clue

276
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,820
But let me start by saying

277
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,820
I love you

278
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:22,820
Hello

279
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:27,820
I love you

280
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:36,820
Charles Johnson

281
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,820
Wonderful

282
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:46,820
There is an emergency message for Mr. Stengel from Dupre, Wisconsin

283
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:49,820
Would you please report to the secretary station

284
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:52,820
Mr. Stengel from Dupre, Wisconsin

285
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:56,820
We'd next like to introduce you an act that really is one of the finest in the country

286
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:00,820
Jimmy Milton has appeared on Grand Ole Opry

287
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:05,820
He is the entertainer of the year in the Louisiana Hayride

288
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,820
He's from Chester City, Tennessee

289
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,820
Jimmy Milton and his father

290
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:12,820
Ladies and gentlemen, let's have a big round of applause for the Miltons

291
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,820
Right there they are

292
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,820
Thank you

293
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,820
Thank you

294
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,820
Thank you very much

295
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,820
We're going to do a song right now

296
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:10,820
I'm going to dedicate this one

297
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:13,820
Narrow it down a little bit

298
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:16,820
Got any rodeoers out there

299
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,820
Any rodeoers?

300
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:22,820
And we'll include all people from Texas on this song

301
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:41,820
Everything that I got is just what I got on

302
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:45,820
When that sun is high in that Texas sky

303
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:50,820
I'll be looking at your county fair

304
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,820
Amorillo by morning

305
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:57,820
Amorillo I'll be there

306
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:06,820
They took my saddle in Houston

307
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:10,820
Broke my leg in Santa Fe

308
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:14,820
Lost my wife and a girlfriend

309
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:19,820
Somewhere along the way

310
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:23,820
And I'll be looking for aid when they pull that gate

311
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:28,820
And I hope that judge ain't blind

312
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:31,820
Amorillo by morning

313
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:36,820
Amorillo's on my mind

314
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:45,820
Amorillo by morning

315
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:49,820
Up from San Antonio

316
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,820
Everything that I got

317
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:57,820
Is just what I've got on

318
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,820
I ain't got a dime

319
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,820
But what I got is mine

320
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:05,820
I ain't rich but Lord I'm free

321
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,820
And Amorillo by morning

322
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:13,820
Amorillo's where I'll be

323
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:16,820
Amorillo by morning

324
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:21,820
Amorillo's where I'll be

325
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:34,820
Thank you

00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:35,820
Thank you

327
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:38,820
And we're gonna close my part of the show out right fast

328
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:42,820
With a verse and a chorus or two of Foggy Mountain Breakdown

329
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,820
Had it back by popular request

330
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:30,820
Thank you

331
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:57,820

Thank you

333
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:12,820
There's been a fresh contemporary arrangement made

334
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:15,820
Of tunes like Yankee Doodle, Chester and America the Beautiful

335
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:19,820
Which have been put together into a neat patriotic package

336
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,820
That we are going to perform for you right now

337
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:25,820

00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:49,820
Now I'd like a big round of applause please for the Danville, Alabama string band. Will you bring them on Danville, Alabama? Let's roll it. These guys are good and we're going to have a little kicking music here now. You got everything set up? Ladies and gentlemen, the Danville, Alabama band, go.

361
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:22,820
As I sit here, along with my memories, thinking back to the years long ago, to the past, to hear us down in Georgia, and the sweet girl that I used to know. She was young and in love with me only.

362
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:33,820
I was good news and foolish I guess, so I walked her right out of her sweet Georgia heart, and the fact that I'm lonely tells me friends.

363
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:48,820
How I miss my Georgia girl today, how I miss the pine woods and her hot Georgia clay, how I miss the simple life so many miles away, how I miss my Georgia girl today.

364
00:54:52,820 --> 00:55:03,820
Music

365
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:17,820
There's a moon shining bright on my doorstep, like I seem shiny, bright and bright, but it's cool to learn my flasco, and I shoot the moon along with mine.

366
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:32,820
Fifteen years have slipped through my fingers, I've got this night known by the sky, but I won't lose you, my Georgia wings are cold, if I don't see anything this time.

367
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:51,820
How I miss my Georgia girl today, how I miss the pine woods and her hot Georgia clay, how I miss the simple life so many miles away, how I miss my Georgia girl today, how I miss my Georgia girl today.

Well, these highway 40 blue, I won't tell them off my shoes, how many days since I've been gone, I've loved seeing the lights at home, wasted time with money too, so I need to search the truth.

370
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:25,820
In the kid I had to lose, lose a little bit of paper, cause I've got these highway 40 miles away.

371
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:38,820
I wake home when I was young, told me lies are things that come, leaving fortune lies ahead, that's what the moonlight has said.

372
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:52,820
Shedding dreams of mine is done, money is ghost, I got my gun, I don't feel with bitter tears, but ain't been holding you, I think I wake 40 miles away.

373
00:56:55,820 --> 00:57:21,820
Music

374
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:35,820
You know I've rambled all around, I could roll myself in town to town, with pretty girls that have to say, none of them can make me stay.

375
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:49,820
I'm playing music all the time, and fancy clothes, big climb cars, think some country boy can't use, think some land is yours, you got these highway 40 miles away.

379
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:30,820
Hello everyone, I'm Shanna Murdoch from the Washington Association.

380
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:38,820
In our next number, the band will be featuring three very talented trumpet players.

381
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:51,820
Their names are Mark Obertas of Montana, Steve Szilacic from Wisconsin, and James Greenwald of Wyoming.

382
00:58:52,820 --> 00:59:03,820
And I'd also like to add that James is a member of the McDonald's All American High School Band, which will be performing at Macy's at Thanksgiving time, and in the Rose Parade in California.

383
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:10,820
Now I'm very pleased to present you with Bugler's Holiday.

Before I introduce our next song, we have an announcement with Doug Stengel, please go to the information booth which is outside in the lobby.

401
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:40,820
This next song has been very popular for quite some time, and the soloist we have to present to you tonight is probably one of the finest I've seen in a long time.

402
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:49,820
He's probably even better than the record itself. We hope that the chills we experience each time we say these words will be conveyed to you.

403
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:57,820
Now allow me to introduce Jason Frazier, a guy we all like to call Bird, representing the Texas Association.

Good evening, future farmers. My name is Maureen Freeman and I represent the state of Nebraska.

428
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:24,820
As we look at our American history, we find the pride, the patriotism, and the opportunities granted us, and the next song we're about to play resembles all of those things.

429
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:39,820
We're now proud to introduce to you the John Philip Seuss's famous Stars and Stripes Forever, featuring pickle players Julie Hines of Ohio, Lynette Hess of Wisconsin, and Kanita McCord of Florida.
