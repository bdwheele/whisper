[00:00.000 --> 00:06.280]  140 years ago today, President Abraham Lincoln stood at the site of one of the most important
[00:06.280 --> 00:12.120]  battles of the U.S. Civil War in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. A crowd of some 15,000 had gathered
[00:12.120 --> 00:17.920]  to consecrate a cemetery for Union war-dead. Though brief, the now-famous Gettysburg Address
[00:17.920 --> 00:23.360]  marked a defining moment of the Civil War. Actor Sam Waterston has portrayed President
[00:23.360 --> 00:31.240]  Lincoln on stage and screen. Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth
[00:31.240 --> 00:39.720]  on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition
[00:39.720 --> 00:49.960]  that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether
[00:49.960 --> 00:59.440]  that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met
[00:59.440 --> 01:06.740]  on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as
[01:06.740 --> 01:14.960]  a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It
[01:14.960 --> 01:23.040]  is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But in a larger sense we cannot
[01:23.040 --> 01:31.720]  dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men living
[01:31.720 --> 01:40.600]  and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract.
[01:40.600 --> 01:47.560]  The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget
[01:47.560 --> 01:53.960]  what they did here. It is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished
[01:53.960 --> 02:01.400]  work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us
[02:01.400 --> 02:09.560]  to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us, that from these honored dead we
[02:09.560 --> 02:17.640]  take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion,
[02:17.640 --> 02:27.520]  that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation
[02:27.520 --> 02:39.040]  under God shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people by the people
[02:39.040 --> 03:02.360]  shall not perish from the earth.
