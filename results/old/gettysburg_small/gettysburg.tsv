0	6280	140 years ago today, President Abraham Lincoln stood at the site of one of the most important
6280	12120	battles of the U.S. Civil War in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. A crowd of some 15,000 had gathered
12120	17920	to consecrate a cemetery for Union war-dead. Though brief, the now-famous Gettysburg Address
17920	23360	marked a defining moment of the Civil War. Actor Sam Waterston has portrayed President
23360	31240	Lincoln on stage and screen. Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth
31240	39720	on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition
39720	49960	that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether
49960	59440	that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met
59440	66740	on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as
66740	74960	a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It
74960	83040	is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But in a larger sense we cannot
83040	91720	dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men living
91720	100600	and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract.
100600	107560	The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget
107560	113960	what they did here. It is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished
113960	121400	work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us
121400	129560	to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us, that from these honored dead we
129560	137640	take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion,
137640	147520	that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation
147520	159040	under God shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people by the people
159040	182360	shall not perish from the earth.
