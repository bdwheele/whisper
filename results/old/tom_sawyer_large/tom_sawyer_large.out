[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  A modern day warrior, mean, mean stride Today's Tom Sawyer, mean, mean pride
[00:11.000 --> 00:28.000]  Though his mind is not for rent, don't put him down as arrogant
[00:28.000 --> 00:34.000]  He's reserved a quiet defense, riding out the day's events
[00:34.000 --> 00:57.000]  What do you say about his company? Is what do you say about society?
[00:57.000 --> 01:10.000]  Catch the mist, catch the myth, catch the mystery, catch the myth
[01:10.000 --> 01:27.000]  The world is, the world is, love and life are deep, maybe as its skies are wide
[01:27.000 --> 01:33.000]  Today's Tom Sawyer, he gets high on you And the space he invades, he gets by on you
[01:57.000 --> 02:12.000]  He's reserved a quiet defense, riding out the day's events
[02:12.000 --> 02:27.000]  The world is, the world is, love and life are deep, maybe as its skies are wide
[02:27.000 --> 02:48.000]  Though his mind is not for rent, to any god or government
[02:48.000 --> 03:12.000]  Always hope for your discontent, those changes aren't permanent, but shaking
[03:12.000 --> 03:18.000]  And what do you say about his company? Is what do you say about society?
[03:18.000 --> 03:31.000]  Catch the witness, catch the wit, catch the spirit, catch the spit
[03:31.000 --> 03:48.000]  The world is, the world is, love and life are deep, maybe as its eyes are wide
[03:48.000 --> 03:57.000]  Exit the warrior, today's Tom Sawyer, he gets high on you And the energy you trade, he gets right on to the friction of the day
[04:18.000 --> 04:33.000]  Thanks for watching!
