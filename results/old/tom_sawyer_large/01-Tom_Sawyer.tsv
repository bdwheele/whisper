0	11000	A modern day warrior, mean, mean stride Today's Tom Sawyer, mean, mean pride
11000	28000	Though his mind is not for rent, don't put him down as arrogant
28000	34000	He's reserved a quiet defense, riding out the day's events
34000	57000	What do you say about his company? Is what do you say about society?
57000	70000	Catch the mist, catch the myth, catch the mystery, catch the myth
70000	87000	The world is, the world is, love and life are deep, maybe as its skies are wide
87000	93000	Today's Tom Sawyer, he gets high on you And the space he invades, he gets by on you
117000	132000	He's reserved a quiet defense, riding out the day's events
132000	147000	The world is, the world is, love and life are deep, maybe as its skies are wide
147000	168000	Though his mind is not for rent, to any god or government
168000	192000	Always hope for your discontent, those changes aren't permanent, but shaking
192000	198000	And what do you say about his company? Is what do you say about society?
198000	211000	Catch the witness, catch the wit, catch the spirit, catch the spit
211000	228000	The world is, the world is, love and life are deep, maybe as its eyes are wide
228000	237000	Exit the warrior, today's Tom Sawyer, he gets high on you And the energy you trade, he gets right on to the friction of the day
258000	273000	Thanks for watching!
