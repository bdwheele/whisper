When I think back on all the crap I learned in high school

00:20.000 --> 00:26.000
It's a wonder I can't think at all

00:26.000 --> 00:34.000
And when my lack of education hasn't hurt me none

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
I can read the writing on the wall

00:39.000 --> 00:46.000
Kodachrome, it gives us those nice bright colors

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Gives us the greens of summers

00:49.000 --> 00:55.000
Makes you think all the words of a sunny day

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
Oh yeah, I got an icon camera

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
I love to take a photograph

01:03.000 --> 01:09.000
So mama don't take my Kodachrome away

01:14.000 --> 01:22.000
If you took all the girls I knew when I was single

01:22.000 --> 01:28.000
And brought them all together for one night

01:28.000 --> 01:36.000
I know they'd never match my sweet imagination

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
And everything looks worse in black and white

01:41.000 --> 01:47.000
Kodachrome, it gives us those nice bright colors

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
Gives us the greens of summers

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
Makes you think all the words of a sunny day

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
Oh yeah, I got an icon camera

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
I love to take a photograph

02:04.000 --> 02:11.000
So mama don't take my Kodachrome away

02:12.000 --> 02:21.000
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away

02:21.000 --> 02:28.000
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away

02:28.000 --> 02:35.000
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
Mama don't take my Kodachrome

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
Mama don't Hyme your bars so far from home

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away

03:05.000 --> 03:11.000
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
