1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
When I think back on all the crap I learned in high school

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's a wonder I can't think at all

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And when my lack of education hasn't hurt me none

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I can read the writing on the wall

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Kodachrome, it gives us those nice bright colors

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Gives us the greens of summers

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Makes you think all the words of a sunny day

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Oh yeah, I got an icon camera

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I love to take a photograph

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So mama don't take my Kodachrome away

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If you took all the girls I knew when I was single

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And brought them all together for one night

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I know they'd never match my sweet imagination

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And everything looks worse in black and white

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Kodachrome, it gives us those nice bright colors

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Gives us the greens of summers

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Makes you think all the words of a sunny day

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Oh yeah, I got an icon camera

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I love to take a photograph

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So mama don't take my Kodachrome away

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Mama don't take my Kodachrome

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Mama don't Hyme your bars so far from home

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
