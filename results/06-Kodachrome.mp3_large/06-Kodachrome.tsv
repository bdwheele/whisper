0	20000	When I think back on all the crap I learned in high school
20000	26000	It's a wonder I can't think at all
26000	34000	And when my lack of education hasn't hurt me none
34000	39000	I can read the writing on the wall
39000	46000	Kodachrome, it gives us those nice bright colors
46000	49000	Gives us the greens of summers
49000	55000	Makes you think all the words of a sunny day
55000	60000	Oh yeah, I got an icon camera
60000	63000	I love to take a photograph
63000	69000	So mama don't take my Kodachrome away
74000	82000	If you took all the girls I knew when I was single
82000	88000	And brought them all together for one night
88000	96000	I know they'd never match my sweet imagination
96000	101000	And everything looks worse in black and white
101000	107000	Kodachrome, it gives us those nice bright colors
107000	111000	Gives us the greens of summers
111000	116000	Makes you think all the words of a sunny day
116000	121000	Oh yeah, I got an icon camera
121000	124000	I love to take a photograph
124000	131000	So mama don't take my Kodachrome away
132000	141000	Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
141000	148000	Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
148000	155000	Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
156000	161000	Mama don't take my Kodachrome
161000	164000	Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
164000	168000	Mama don't Hyme your bars so far from home
168000	173000	Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
173000	177000	Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
185000	191000	Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
