[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  A modern day warrior, mean, mean stride Today's Tom Sawyer, mean, mean pride
[00:23.000 --> 00:28.000]  Though his mind is not for rent Don't put him down his hair again
[00:28.000 --> 00:33.000]  His reserve of quiet defense Writing out the day's events
[00:34.000 --> 00:36.000]  In the river
[00:52.000 --> 00:57.000]  What do you say about his company? Is what you say about society?
[00:57.000 --> 01:03.000]  Catch the mist, catch the myth Catch the mystery, catch the grip
[01:11.000 --> 01:17.000]  The world is, the world is Love and life are deep
[01:18.000 --> 01:24.000]  Maybe as his skies are wide
[01:27.000 --> 01:33.000]  Today's Tom Sawyer, he gets high on you And the space he invades, he gets by on you
[01:57.000 --> 02:02.000]  Love and life are deep
[02:27.000 --> 02:31.000]  Love and life are deep
[02:43.000 --> 02:48.000]  Though his mind is not for rent To any god or government
[02:49.000 --> 02:54.000]  Always hope for your discontent Those changes aren't permanent
[02:54.000 --> 02:57.000]  More changes
[03:12.000 --> 03:17.000]  And what do you say about his company? Is what you say about society?
[03:17.000 --> 03:23.000]  Catch the witness, catch the wit Catch the spirit, catch the spirit
[03:31.000 --> 03:37.000]  The world is, the world is Love and life are deep
[03:38.000 --> 03:44.000]  Maybe as his eyes are wide
[03:48.000 --> 03:53.000]  Exit the warrior today's Tom Sawyer He gets high on you and the energy you trade
[03:53.000 --> 03:57.000]  He gets right on to the friction of the day
[04:17.000 --> 04:22.000]  Thank you for watching!
