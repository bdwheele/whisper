00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
A modern day warrior, mean, mean stride Today's Tom Sawyer, mean, mean pride

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
Though his mind is not for rent Don't put him down his hair again

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
His reserve of quiet defense Writing out the day's events

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
In the river

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
What do you say about his company? Is what you say about society?

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
Catch the mist, catch the myth Catch the mystery, catch the grip

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
The world is, the world is Love and life are deep

01:18.000 --> 01:24.000
Maybe as his skies are wide

01:27.000 --> 01:33.000
Today's Tom Sawyer, he gets high on you And the space he invades, he gets by on you

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
Love and life are deep

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
Love and life are deep

02:43.000 --> 02:48.000
Though his mind is not for rent To any god or government

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
Always hope for your discontent Those changes aren't permanent

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
More changes

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
And what do you say about his company? Is what you say about society?

03:17.000 --> 03:23.000
Catch the witness, catch the wit Catch the spirit, catch the spirit

03:31.000 --> 03:37.000
The world is, the world is Love and life are deep

03:38.000 --> 03:44.000
Maybe as his eyes are wide

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
Exit the warrior today's Tom Sawyer He gets high on you and the energy you trade

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
He gets right on to the friction of the day

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
Thank you for watching!
