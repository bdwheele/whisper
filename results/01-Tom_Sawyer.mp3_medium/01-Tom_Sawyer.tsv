0	11000	A modern day warrior, mean, mean stride Today's Tom Sawyer, mean, mean pride
23000	28000	Though his mind is not for rent Don't put him down his hair again
28000	33000	His reserve of quiet defense Writing out the day's events
34000	36000	In the river
52000	57000	What do you say about his company? Is what you say about society?
57000	63000	Catch the mist, catch the myth Catch the mystery, catch the grip
71000	77000	The world is, the world is Love and life are deep
78000	84000	Maybe as his skies are wide
87000	93000	Today's Tom Sawyer, he gets high on you And the space he invades, he gets by on you
117000	122000	Love and life are deep
147000	151000	Love and life are deep
163000	168000	Though his mind is not for rent To any god or government
169000	174000	Always hope for your discontent Those changes aren't permanent
174000	177000	More changes
192000	197000	And what do you say about his company? Is what you say about society?
197000	203000	Catch the witness, catch the wit Catch the spirit, catch the spirit
211000	217000	The world is, the world is Love and life are deep
218000	224000	Maybe as his eyes are wide
228000	233000	Exit the warrior today's Tom Sawyer He gets high on you and the energy you trade
233000	237000	He gets right on to the friction of the day
257000	262000	Thank you for watching!
