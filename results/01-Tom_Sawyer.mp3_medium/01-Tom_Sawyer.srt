1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
A modern day warrior, mean, mean stride Today's Tom Sawyer, mean, mean pride

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Though his mind is not for rent Don't put him down his hair again

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
His reserve of quiet defense Writing out the day's events

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
In the river

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What do you say about his company? Is what you say about society?

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Catch the mist, catch the myth Catch the mystery, catch the grip

7
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The world is, the world is Love and life are deep

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Maybe as his skies are wide

9
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Today's Tom Sawyer, he gets high on you And the space he invades, he gets by on you

10
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Love and life are deep

11
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Love and life are deep

12
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Though his mind is not for rent To any god or government

13
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Always hope for your discontent Those changes aren't permanent

14
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
More changes

15
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And what do you say about his company? Is what you say about society?

16
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Catch the witness, catch the wit Catch the spirit, catch the spirit

17
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The world is, the world is Love and life are deep

18
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Maybe as his eyes are wide

19
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Exit the warrior today's Tom Sawyer He gets high on you and the energy you trade

20
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
He gets right on to the friction of the day

21
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Thank you for watching!
