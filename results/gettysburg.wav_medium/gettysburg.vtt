00:00.000 --> 00:06.260
140 years ago today, President Abraham Lincoln stood at the site of one of the most important

00:06.260 --> 00:12.100
battles of the U.S. Civil War in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. A crowd of some 15,000 had gathered

00:12.100 --> 00:17.900
to consecrate a cemetery for Union war dead. Though brief, the now famous Gettysburg Address

00:17.900 --> 00:23.360
marked a defining moment of the Civil War. Actor Sam Waterston has portrayed President

00:23.360 --> 00:26.080
Lincoln on stage and screen.

00:26.080 --> 00:34.960
Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation,

00:34.960 --> 00:44.540
conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

00:44.540 --> 00:53.440
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived

00:53.440 --> 01:03.240
and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We

01:03.240 --> 01:10.160
have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here

01:10.160 --> 01:17.280
gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we

01:17.280 --> 01:27.600
should do this. But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we

01:27.600 --> 01:35.000
cannot hallow this ground. The brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated

01:35.000 --> 01:44.000
it far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember

01:44.240 --> 01:51.240
what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living,

01:51.240 --> 01:57.380
rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus

01:57.380 --> 02:04.380
far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining

02:04.380 --> 02:11.380
before us, that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for

02:12.380 --> 02:19.380
which they gave the last full measure of devotion. That we here highly resolve that these dead

02:21.380 --> 02:28.380
shall not have died in vain, that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom,

02:32.380 --> 02:39.380
and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall have a new birth

02:41.380 --> 03:02.460
shall not perish from the earth.
