0	6260	140 years ago today, President Abraham Lincoln stood at the site of one of the most important
6260	12100	battles of the U.S. Civil War in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. A crowd of some 15,000 had gathered
12100	17900	to consecrate a cemetery for Union war dead. Though brief, the now famous Gettysburg Address
17900	23360	marked a defining moment of the Civil War. Actor Sam Waterston has portrayed President
23360	26080	Lincoln on stage and screen.
26080	34960	Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation,
34960	44540	conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
44540	53440	Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived
53440	63240	and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We
63240	70160	have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here
70160	77280	gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we
77280	87600	should do this. But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we
87600	95000	cannot hallow this ground. The brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated
95000	104000	it far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember
104240	111240	what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living,
111240	117380	rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus
117380	124380	far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining
124380	131380	before us, that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for
132380	139380	which they gave the last full measure of devotion. That we here highly resolve that these dead
141380	148380	shall not have died in vain, that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom,
152380	159380	and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall have a new birth
161380	182460	shall not perish from the earth.
