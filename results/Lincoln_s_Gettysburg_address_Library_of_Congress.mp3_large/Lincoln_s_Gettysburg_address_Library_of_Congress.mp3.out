[00:00.000 --> 00:09.900]  The National Cemetery at Gettysburg was dedicated on November the 19th, 1863.
[00:09.900 --> 00:16.020]  It commemorated the decisive battle of the Great Civil War, which had been fought there
[00:16.020 --> 00:19.020]  some four months earlier.
[00:19.020 --> 00:25.620]  The oration of the day was delivered by the brilliant orator Edward Everett and occupied
[00:25.620 --> 00:27.540]  two hours.
[00:27.540 --> 00:34.020]  At its close, President Lincoln, with a few notes which he had penciled on the train while
[00:34.020 --> 00:39.100]  coming from Washington, spoke for barely three minutes.
[00:39.100 --> 00:42.660]  The speech of Everett has been forgotten.
[00:42.660 --> 00:50.600]  The speech of Lincoln will be remembered until languages are dead and lips are dust.
[00:50.600 --> 00:57.520]  It measures up to all of Daniel Webster's famous requirements, that a great speech consists
[00:57.520 --> 01:04.080]  of three things, the man, the subject, and the occasion.
[01:04.080 --> 01:07.600]  These are Lincoln's undying words.
[01:07.600 --> 01:19.560]  Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation
[01:19.560 --> 01:29.160]  conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
[01:29.160 --> 01:39.280]  Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived
[01:39.280 --> 01:44.640]  and so dedicated can long endure.
[01:44.640 --> 01:50.040]  We are met on a great battlefield of that war.
[01:50.040 --> 01:58.240]  We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who
[01:58.240 --> 02:04.240]  here gave their lives that that nation might live.
[02:04.240 --> 02:10.520]  It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
[02:10.520 --> 02:23.520]  But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground.
[02:23.520 --> 02:33.800]  The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor
[02:33.800 --> 02:37.680]  power to add or detract.
[02:37.680 --> 02:45.880]  The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget
[02:45.880 --> 02:49.160]  what they did here.
[02:49.160 --> 02:57.320]  It is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who
[02:57.320 --> 03:02.880]  fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.
[03:02.880 --> 03:11.360]  It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us, that
[03:11.360 --> 03:20.320]  from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they here
[03:20.320 --> 03:30.200]  gave the last full measure of devotion, that we here highly resolve that these dead shall
[03:30.200 --> 03:39.000]  not have died in vain, that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom, and
[03:39.000 --> 03:48.200]  that government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from the
[03:48.200 --> 03:48.560]  earth.
