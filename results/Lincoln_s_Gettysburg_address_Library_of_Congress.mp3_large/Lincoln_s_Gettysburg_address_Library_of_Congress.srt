1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,900
The National Cemetery at Gettysburg was dedicated on November the 19th, 1863.

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:16,020
It commemorated the decisive battle of the Great Civil War, which had been fought there

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,020
some four months earlier.

4
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:25,620
The oration of the day was delivered by the brilliant orator Edward Everett and occupied

5
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,540
two hours.

6
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:34,020
At its close, President Lincoln, with a few notes which he had penciled on the train while

7
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,100
coming from Washington, spoke for barely three minutes.

8
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,660
The speech of Everett has been forgotten.

9
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:50,600
The speech of Lincoln will be remembered until languages are dead and lips are dust.

10
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:57,520
It measures up to all of Daniel Webster's famous requirements, that a great speech consists

11
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:04,080
of three things, the man, the subject, and the occasion.

12
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,600
These are Lincoln's undying words.

13
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:19,560
Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation

14
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:29,160
conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

15
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:39,280
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived

16
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,640
and so dedicated can long endure.

17
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,040
We are met on a great battlefield of that war.

18
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:58,240
We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who

19
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,240
here gave their lives that that nation might live.

20
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,520
It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

21
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:23,520
But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground.

22
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:33,800
The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor

23
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,680
power to add or detract.

24
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:45,880
The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget

25
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,160
what they did here.

26
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:57,320
It is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who

27
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:02,880
fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.

28
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:11,360
It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us, that

29
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:20,320
from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they here

30
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:30,200
gave the last full measure of devotion, that we here highly resolve that these dead shall

31
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:39,000
not have died in vain, that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom, and

32
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:48,200
that government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from the

33
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:48,560
earth.
