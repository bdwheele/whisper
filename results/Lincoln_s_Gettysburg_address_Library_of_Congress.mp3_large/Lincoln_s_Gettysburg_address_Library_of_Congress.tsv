0	9900	The National Cemetery at Gettysburg was dedicated on November the 19th, 1863.
9900	16020	It commemorated the decisive battle of the Great Civil War, which had been fought there
16020	19020	some four months earlier.
19020	25620	The oration of the day was delivered by the brilliant orator Edward Everett and occupied
25620	27540	two hours.
27540	34020	At its close, President Lincoln, with a few notes which he had penciled on the train while
34020	39100	coming from Washington, spoke for barely three minutes.
39100	42660	The speech of Everett has been forgotten.
42660	50600	The speech of Lincoln will be remembered until languages are dead and lips are dust.
50600	57520	It measures up to all of Daniel Webster's famous requirements, that a great speech consists
57520	64080	of three things, the man, the subject, and the occasion.
64080	67600	These are Lincoln's undying words.
67600	79560	Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation
79560	89160	conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
89160	99280	Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived
99280	104640	and so dedicated can long endure.
104640	110040	We are met on a great battlefield of that war.
110040	118240	We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who
118240	124240	here gave their lives that that nation might live.
124240	130520	It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
130520	143520	But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground.
143520	153800	The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor
153800	157680	power to add or detract.
157680	165880	The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget
165880	169160	what they did here.
169160	177320	It is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who
177320	182880	fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.
182880	191360	It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us, that
191360	200320	from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they here
200320	210200	gave the last full measure of devotion, that we here highly resolve that these dead shall
210200	219000	not have died in vain, that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom, and
219000	228200	that government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from the
228200	228560	earth.
