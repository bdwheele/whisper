When I think back on all the crap I learned in high school
It s a wonder I can {+t+} think at all
And though my lack of education hasn t hurt me none
I can read the writing on the wall
Kodachrome it gives us those nice bright colors
[-Give-]
{+Gives+} us the greens of summers
Makes you think all the [-world s-] {+words of+} a sunny day
Oh yeah I got [-a Nikon-] {+an icon+} camera
I love to take a photograph
So mama don t take my Kodachrome away
If you took all the girls I knew when I was single
And brought [-em-] {+them+} all together for one night
I know they d never match my sweet imagination
And everything looks worse in black and white
Kodachrome it gives us those nice bright colors
[-It-]
Gives us the greens of summers
Makes you think all the [-world s-] {+words of+} a sunny day
Oh yeah I got [-a Nikon-] {+an icon+} camera
I love to take a photograph
So mama don t take my Kodachrome away
Mama don t take my Kodachrome away
Mama don t take my Kodachrome away
Mama don t take my Kodachrome away
Mama don t take my Kodachrome
[-Mama don t take my Kodachrome
Mama don t take my Kodachrome-] away
Mama don t take my Kodachrome {+away+}
Leave your [-boy so far from home-] {+bars up off the phone+}
Mama don t take my Kodachrome away
Mama don t take my Kodachrome
[-Oh oooh oooh oooh
Mama don t take my Kodachrome-] away

[-Okay-]
{+Kodachrome+}
