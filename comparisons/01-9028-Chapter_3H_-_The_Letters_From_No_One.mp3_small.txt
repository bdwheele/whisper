Wouldn t it be better just to go home dear [-Aunt Petunia-] 
{+Armpitunia+} suggested timidly hours later But Uncle Vernon didn t seem to hear her 
Exactly what he was looking for none of them knew He drove them into the middle of a forest 
got out looked around shook his head got back [-in-] {+into+} the car and off they went again 
The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field halfway across a suspension
bridge and at the top of a [-multilevel-] {+multi level+} parking garage 
Daddy s gone mad hasn t he Dudley asked [-Aunt Petunia-] {+Armpitunia+} Dully [-late-] {+later+} that afternoon 
Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast locked them all inside the car and disappeared 
It started to rain Great drops beat on the roof of the car [-Dud ley-] {+Dudley+} sniveled 
It s Monday he told his mother The great Humberto s on [-tonight-] {+to night+} I want to stay somewhere
with [-a-] {+the+} television 
[-Monday-] 
This reminded Harry of something If it was Monday and you could usually count on Dudley
to know the days {+of+} the week because of television then tomorrow Tuesday was Harry s eleventh
birthday Of course his birthdays were never exactly fun Last year the Dursleys had given
him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon s old socks Still you weren t eleven every
day Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling He was also carrying a long thin package 
and didn t answer [-Aunt Petunia-] {+Armpitunia+} when she asked what he d bought 
Found the perfect place he said Come on everyone out 
It was very cold outside the car Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock
way out at sea Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could
imagine One thing was certain there was no television in there 
Storm forecast for tonight said Uncle Vernon gleefully clapping his hands together and
this gentleman s kindly agreed to lend us his boat A toothless old man came ambling
up to them pointing with a rather wicked grin at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron [-gray-] {+grey+}
water below them 
I ve already got us some rations said Uncle Vernon so all aboard 
It was freezing in the boat [-Icy sea-] {+ICC+} spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly
wind whipped their faces After what seemed like hours they reached the rock where Uncle
Vernon slipping and sliding led the way to the broken down house The inside was horrible 
It smelled strongly of seaweed The wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls and
the fireplace was damp and empty There were only two rooms 
Uncle Vernon s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas He tried
to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up 
Could do with some of those letters now eh He said cheerfully 
He was in a very good mood Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here
in a storm to deliver mail Harry privately agreed though the thought didn t cheer him
