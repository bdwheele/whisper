A modern day warrior mean mean stride Today s Tom Sawyer mean mean pride
Though his mind is not for rent Don t put him down [-as arrogant-] {+his hair again+}
His reserve [-a-] {+of+} quiet defense
[-Riding-] {+Writing+} out the day s events
{+In+} the river
What {+do+} you say about his company Is what you say about society 
Catch the mist catch the myth Catch the mystery catch the [-drift-] {+grip+}
The world is the world is Love and life are deep
Maybe as his skies are wide
Today s Tom Sawyer he gets high on you And the space he invades he gets by on you
[-No-]
{+Love and life are deep
Love and life are deep
Though+} his mind is not for rent To any god or government
Always [-hopeful yet-] {+hope for your+} discontent
[-He knows-] {+Those+} changes aren t permanent
[-But change is-]
{+More changes+}
And what {+do+} you say about his company Is what you say about society 
Catch the witness catch the wit Catch the spirit catch the [-spit-] {+spirit+}
The world is the world is Love and life are deep
Maybe as his eyes are wide
Exit the warrior today s Tom Sawyer He gets high on you and the energy you trade
He gets right on to the friction of the day
{+Thank you for watching+}
