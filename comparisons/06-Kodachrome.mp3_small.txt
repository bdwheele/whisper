When I think back on all the crap I learned in high school
It s a wonder I can {+t+} think at all
And [-though-] {+when+} my lack of education hasn t hurt me none
I can read the writing on the wall

[-Kodachrome-]
{+Cold or cold+} it gives [-us-] those nice bright colors
[-Give-]
{+Gives+} us the greens of summers
Makes you think all the [-world s-] {+words of+} a sunny day
Oh yeah I got [-a Nikon-] {+an eye on+} camera
I {+d+} love to take a photograph
So mama don t take my [-Kodachrome-] {+cold control+} away
If you took all the girls I knew when I was [-single-] {+sailor+}
And brought [-em-] {+them+} all together for one night
I know they [-d-] never match my sweet imagination
And everything looks worse in black and white

[-Kodachrome-]
{+Cold or cold+} it gives [-us-] those nice bright colors
[-It-]
Gives us the greens of summers
Makes you think all the [-world s-] {+words of+} a sunny day
Oh yeah I got [-a Nikon-] {+an eye on+} camera
I {+d+} love to take a photograph
So mama don t take my [-Kodachrome-] {+cold control+} away
Mama don t take my [-Kodachrome-] {+cold control+} away
Mama don t take my [-Kodachrome-] {+cold control+} away
Mama don t take my [-Kodachrome-] {+cold control+} away
Mama don t take my [-Kodachrome
Mama don t take my Kodachrome
Mama don t take my Kodachrome-] {+cold control+} away
Mama don t take my [-Kodachrome
Leave your boy so far from home-] {+cold control away+}
Mama don t take my [-Kodachrome-] {+cold control+} away
Mama don t take my [-Kodachrome
Oh oooh oooh oooh-] {+cold control away+}
Mama don t take my [-Kodachrome-] {+cold control+} away

[-Okay-]
