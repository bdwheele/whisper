A modern day warrior mean mean stride Today s Tom Sawyer mean mean pride
Though his mind is not for rent don t put him down as arrogant
[-His reserve-]
{+He s reserved+} a quiet defense riding out the day s events
[-The river-]
What {+do+} you say about his company Is what {+do+} you say about society 
Catch the mist catch the myth catch the mystery catch the [-drift-] {+myth+}
The world is the world is love and life are deep maybe as [-his-] {+its+} skies are wide
Today s Tom Sawyer he gets high on you And the space he invades he gets by on you
[-No-]
{+He s reserved a quiet defense riding out the day s events
The world is the world is love and life are deep maybe as its skies are wide
Though+} his mind is not for rent to any god or government
Always [-hopeful yet-] {+hope for your+} discontent
[-He knows-] {+those+} changes aren t permanent but [-change is-] {+shaking+}
And what {+do+} you say about his company Is what {+do+} you say about society 
Catch the witness catch the wit catch the spirit catch the spit
The world is the world is love and life are deep maybe as [-his-] {+its+} eyes are wide
Exit the warrior today s Tom Sawyer he gets high on you And the energy you trade he gets right on to the friction of the day
{+Thanks for watching+}
